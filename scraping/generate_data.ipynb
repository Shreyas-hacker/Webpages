image for vaping ecigarettes last published january what is vaping ecigarettes are batteryoperated devices that are used to heat a liquid to produce a vapour which is then inhaled mimicking the act of smoking this is commonly referred to as vaping ecigarettes are mostly used to vape nicotine eliquid solutions devices can also be used to inhale other drugs such as thc cannabis or nicotinefree eliquids which are made from a mixture of chemicals including solvents sweeteners and flavourings such as fruit lollies coffee or alcohol devices usually resemble cigarettes cigars or pipes as well as everyday items such as pens usb memory sticks and larger cylindrical or rectangular devices vaping vape vapes pens pods juul ehookah electronic cigarettes electronic nicotine delivery systems ends ecigs ecigarro electrosmoke green cig smartsmoker ecigarettes use heat to transform a nicotine or nonnicotine eliquid solution into vapour which is then inhaled people vape for various reasons including to help them reduce or quit smoking belief that they are less harmful than traditional cigarettes cheaper than traditional cigarettes taste better than traditional cigarettes can vape in places where traditional cigarettes are banned curiosity seen as more acceptable than traditional cigarettes there is not enough evidence to promote the use of ecigarettes for the purpose of smoking cessation the therapeutic goods administration tga is yet to approve ecigarettes as a quit tool while switching to vaping may help some people quit smoking traditional cigarettes there is concern that smokers may become dual users of both ecigarettes and tobacco cigarettes and that former smokers who now vape are more likely to relapse to current smokers is vaping safer than traditional cigarettes while its widely believed that vaping causes less harm than smoking cigarettes because vapes dont contain tobacco tobacco contains a majority of the toxic cancer causing chemicals its still not harmless there are known risks associated with any type of nicotine exposure on brain development meaning that pregnant women and adolescents should avoid vaping nicotine can damage dna promote tumours and is linked to a number of different cancers there are also risks linked to nicotine poisoning via ingestion and skin contact with the eliquid solutions the manufacturer quality of vaping devices is highly variable significant differences in product designs and the way people use them make it difficult to determine the potential level of nicotine toxicity in each device or liquid vaping devices can be modified to deliver a higher more harmful concentration of nicotine and producing more toxic chemical particles in the inhaled vape cloud with or without nicotine all eliquid solutions used in vaping contain a mixture of unregulated and harmful chemicals and additives the two main ingredients used in all eliquids are propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin which are considered safe in certain food products however the health consequences of repeatedly heating and inhaling these chemicals into the lungs is relatively unknown with some evidence suggesting there is potential to cause harm vapes may also contain toxins such as formaldehyde and heavy metals such as chromium aluminium arsenic copper lead nickel and tin all of which cause adverse health effects including cancer other chemicals found include volatile organic compounds common in paint and cleaning products ultrafine particles which are damaging to lungs chlorophenol used in disinfectants and other carcinogens nicotine labelling on vapes can also be inconsistent with some labels incorrectly denying the presence of nicotine and other potentially toxic chemicals concerns have also been raised about the appeal of vaping products to young people companies glamourise their products to appear cool or fun and create flavours that give off the perception of sweetness such as candy or fruit flavoured which appeal directly to young people concerning trends are being noted in a number of countries showing uptake of vaping among adolescents and children vaping and the law is it legal
