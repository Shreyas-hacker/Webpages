hot stories of the week next senator calls for dedicated us data protection agency by lisa vaas the guy who allegedly wanted to be the dark nets goto money launderer by acting as a bitcoin mixer soliciting cryptocurrency from crooks slicing and dicing the coins and then remixing them in an ultimately futile attempt to obscure their source has been busted the us department of justice doj announced on thursday that larry harmon of akron ohio has been indicted on three counts of allegedly running a bitcoin mixer service called helix from to these services are also called bitcoin tumblers which is how harmon allegedly referred to helix in his sales pitch to the underworld this is how the indictment summarizes harmons alleged first post about his service in june a pitch to convince criminals to pay him to hide their transactions from law enforcement before launching helix harmon posted online that helix was designed to be a bitcoin tumbler that cleans bitcoins by providing customers with new bitcoins which have never been to the darknet before harmon allegedly went on to promise that there was no way that law enforcement could tell which addresses are helix addresses given that the service uses new addresses for each transaction his alleged illscareyoucrooksintopaying followup advertising spiel no one has ever been arrested just through bitcoin taint but it is possible and do you want to be the first most markets use hot wallets they put all their fees in these wallets law enforcement just needs to check the taints on these wallets to find all the addresses a market uses in short taints are the trail left by bitcoins as they travel from wallet to wallet heres a discussion about traceability from stack exchange harmons helix bitcoin mixer allegedly moved at least bitcoin on behalf of customers a sum that was valued at over million at the time of the transactions and which is now worth about usd billion most of those customers came in from dark net markets helix had partnered with alphabay one of the largest dark net markets before law enforcement seized it in july to provide bitcoin laundering for alphabays customers harmons also been linked to grams a dark net search engine other dark net marketplaces that funneled funds to helix included agora market nucleus and dream market according to the indictment one of those bitcoin transfers led to harmons bust in november an fbi agent working undercover transferred bitcoin from an alphabay bitcoin wallet to helix the tumbler mixed it up and exchanged it for an equivalent amount of clean coins minus a fee of those new coins werent directly traceable to alphabay but that hasnt stopped law enforcement in the past in january for example researchers figured out how to unmask dark web markets buyers and sellers by forensically connecting them to bitcoin transactions threat hunting detection and response delivered by an expert team as a fullymanaged service learn more they didnt unmask many and granted those they did manage to identify made mistakes that were more common in the early less careful days of dealing in cryptocurrency they didnt hide transactions using bitcoin laundering services for example while some were none too scrupulous about using fake online identities that couldnt be traced to personally identifiable information pii helix isnt the first mixing service to go down in nonanonymous flames a string of mixing services have eventually figured out that bitcoin transactions arent fully anonymous thats why in july the biggest mixer of the day bitmixer abruptly shut down although bitmixers operator denied the connection at the time its closure came fast on the heels of the shutdowns of the alphabay and hansa dark markets the reason why bitmixer closed up shop it may have taken its operators a few years of operating but they finally realized that bitcoin doesnt have additional protections for pii by design not by omission bitmixers epiphany and shutdown came a week after google and blockchain analysis firm chainalysis which markets a tool called reactor to track and analyze the movement of bitcoin announced that they had managed to track ransomware payments paid in bitcoin from end to end some of those ransomware payments had been moved through bitcoin mixers that doesnt mean that all bitcoin mixer payments are done for illicit purposes mind you in fact chainalysis said in august that most mix transactions are done for additional privacy in spite of that was not a good time for mixers many of which like helix made their sales pitches directly to the solidly illicit crowd in fact bitmixer shut down three days after the doj shut down btce a fraudulent russian cryptocurrency exchange that was handling of all ransomware payments at the time and which itself relied on mixing services criminals seem to think that the dark net and cryptocurrency have a lot more opaque nooks and crannies than it does the fbi suggests heres a statement from special agent in charge timothy m dunham of the criminal division of the fbi washington field office the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency and the darknet may appeal to criminals as a refuge to hide their illicit activity however as harmons arrest demonstrates the fbi and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing the illegal practices of money launderers and other financial criminals to light and to justice regardless of whether they are using new technological means to carry out their schemes listen now clickanddrag on the soundwaves below
