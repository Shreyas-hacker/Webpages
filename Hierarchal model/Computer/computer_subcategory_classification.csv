menggunakan foto ataupun gambar saja yang mana itu adalah merupakan hal membosankan untuk bisa kita lihat di dalam handphone kita sehingga kita perlu pembaruan yang lebih menarik didalam handphone kita sehingga mata tidak bosan memandangnya untuk itu anda harus mencoba berbagai wallpaper yang bisa merubah wajah handphone anda salah satunya adalah dengan mengubah wallpaper yang foto atau animasinya bisa bergerak sehingga wallpaper handphone anda lebih berwarna dan lebih hidup bila kita memandangnya menggunakan wallpaper bergerak memang bukanlah suatu hal yang baru bila kita temukan di jaman sekarang ini wallpaper bergerak memang sudah marak terlihat sejak dahulu sehingga kita tak perlu heran lagi dengan kecanggihan tersebut akan tetapi memang masih sangat sedikit sekali yang menggunakan wallpaper dengan foto ataupun animasi yang bergerak seakan akan hidup di dalam handphonenya ada beberapa faktor yang mungkin mereka tidak menggunakan salah satunya adalah ketidak mengertian menggunakan wallpaper bergerak tersebut untuk itu kami ingin memberikan informasi bagi anda yang mempunyai niat untuk memakai wallpaper bergerak di handphone pribadi anda sehingga ponsel yang anda gunakan semakin menarik dan juga tidak membosankan bila anda melihatnya selain itu juga anda bisa bermain agen sbobet agar tidak bosan dalam aktifitas sehari hari tapi bukan berarti dengan menggunakan wallpaper bergerak seperti itu tidak memiliki kekurangannya wallpaper bergerak juga memiliki beberapa kekurangan salah satunya adalah mungkin bila anda memiliki handphone yang tidak memiliki spesifikasi yang memadai akan tetapi memakai wallpaper bergerak dampaknya adalah ponsel anda bisa menjadi lemot atau lelet jika anda gunakan karena beratnya wallpaper tersebut dan itu juga menjadi faktor mengapa pada saat ini masih jarang pengguna wallpaper bergerak pertama yang harus anda lakukan adalah mendownload dan instal aplikasi wallpaper hd di smartphone atau android anda kedua setelah anda berhasil menginstal aplikasi tersebut anda langsung bisa membukannya dan menginzinkan aplikasi tersebut mengakse foto anda di galeri ketiga setelah mengizinkan mengakses foto selesai anda maka anda akan di tampilkan seperti di bawah ini pastikan koneksi internet android sudah aktif tekan icon tambah pilih galeri masukan video yang ingin di jadikan wallpaper silahkan mencoba sudah pasti

android terbaik jadikan smartphone anda terlihat keren ada begitu banyak metode untuk membuat android anda terasa dan terlihat luar biasa namun salah satu yang pale nyaman adalah dengan mengunduh gaya android di bawah ini kami telah menyusun daftar periksa tentang apa yang kami yakini sebagai motif android terbaik untuk berbagai peluncur yang semuanya gratis untuk dipasang dan digunakan zenui adalah peluncur yang kuat untuk tema karena tidak memerlukan jenis bonus apa pun dan tidak dimuat dengan banyak bloatware meskipun temanya bukan yang pale teliti paket ikonnya biasanya mencakup hanya aplikasi yang pale mendasar dan juga sere tidak semua yang datang pra instal mereka tetap teratur ikon sea desire semuanya dibuat dengan mahir untuk menyatu dengan tema ikon untuk aplikasi olahpesan misalnya menyerupai pesan dalam botol simbol untuk aplikasi browser internet di sisi lain adalah radar ini hal yang menarik saya hanya berharap paket simbolnya jauh lebih luas pastikan untuk melihat motif fall juga suka tampilan sea dream dapatkan di play store glasklart memiliki banyak ikon berbeda bahkan untuk aplikasi yang sedikit lebih tipikal seperti anututu dan greenify dan tata letak umumnya sangat menakjubkan juga mereka yang tidak dibangun dari awal tidak berhati hati dari tempat di sini aplikasi dalam laci aplikasi seperti hantu ditarik dalam satu warna putih nama nama mereka sulit dilihat dibandingkan sejarah kelabu namun menarik mereka keluar dari kabinet aplikasi dan ke homescreen serta mereka terlihat indah simbol aplikasi diam diam tetapi diarsir secara ahli yang memberikan tampilan yang lembut dan mewah dengan ikon putih dan juga keperakan terhadap kombinasi ungu glasklart sangat disarankan smartphone yang memiliki spek menengah keatas akan sangat membantu anda dalam melakukan permainan judi online pada situs daftar judi bola karena permainan judi online yang dapat diakse melalui gadget membutuhkan spesifikasi smartphone yang mumpuni dan bagus putih

ikon aplikasi seperti kartu pos desain kartu nama ikon asisten pribadi digital khususnya yang mencuri program anda juga bisa mendapatkan banyak gaya untuk launcher pusat bervariasi dari norak hingga terbata menurut pendapat saya adegan musim dingin dua nada white yang tercantum di bawah ini adalah yang pale indah pinko sebenarnya telah menjadi fave android untuk jangka waktu yang lama berkat ikon minimalis dengan perhatian tinggi pada informasi pinko mengubah semua aplikasi anda menjadi lingkaran yang sebenarnya semuanya telah dirancang dan diwarnai dengan perawatan aplikasi dialer muncul seperti bagian mulut dari telepon kuno dan juga pesan dan semua simbol aplikasi hanyalah sekelompok lingkaran itu tidak membuat antarmuka pengguna terlihat jauh berbeda dan juga tidak menggunakan animasi yang mahal juga itu hanya menghasilkan gaya retro praktis yang terlihat lebih rapi dan jauh lebih inovatif daripada banyak tema pelengkap lainnya sejauh ini sebagian besar gaya pada daftar periksa kami sudah bersih dan minimalis namun ada di antara kita yang menyukai gaya keterlaluan sesekali terutama jika itu menarik tema cute rabit persis seperti itu aneh menyenangkan dan juga hidup

menjalankan android yang dibuat khusus motif setelah itu anda dapat memperoleh tema windows mobile dengan benar sini meskipun ada beberapa gaya hebat yang tersedia jika anda menginginkan sesuatu benar benar unik dan juga milik anda sendiri cara terbaik untuk mendapatkannya adalah dengan membuatnya kami juga harus menyebutkan bahwa salah satu peluncur yang pale disukai nova misalnya tidak memiliki dukungan tema sedangkan peluncur lain itu lakukan dapat memiliki iklan frustasi atau fitur tambahan yang tidak diinginkan jadi tema buatan sendiri tidak pernah merupakan konsep negatif bagaimana anda akan mengembangkannya cara termudah adalah menemukan wallpaper serta simbol dengan visual yang cocok saat ini itu cukup sederhana karena sebagian besar ikon ikon dibundel dengan wallpaper bertema namun demikian anda dapat menjelajahi aplikasi seperti muzei yang menyediakan wallpaper hidup atau tapet yang membuat wallpaper seorang favorit saya mengambil screenshot dari video game monument

left nothing to chance while compiling our best cryptocurrency website list in the crypto and blockchain scene knowing fully well that it is impossible to produce unbiased reviews without first getting a feel of the product we at cryptolinks have therefore decided to base our research on an experimental and organic approach for this project we adopted an organic analytic methodology which entailed the assessment of information garnered from the firsthand utilization of the products or cryptocurrency websites under review this methodology guarantees unfiltered information on the core functionalities of websites as opposed to the unreliable results often generated from the complete reliance on thirdparty publications apart from fixating on features we conducted background research on the teams backing the products subsequently we gauged crypto community feedback and assessed track records below are some of the criteria we almost always use to judge the competence and viability of crypto tools and websites user interface and design many believe that crypto technology is yet to achieve mainstream success because of its complex nature and so we expect every crypto developer and firm out there to use their platforms to debunk this notion by implementing easytouse crypto tools and features in other words one of the first things we check when analyzing the quality of crypto websites is their design and user experience cryptolinks ensures that it prioritizes websites which have done enough to simplify the processes involved in engaging with the crypto universe this task entails the careful analysis of the uxui of crypto websites and how easy it is for newbies to integrate utilize and navigate implemented features crypto fees other than user experience we focus on the pricing structure of the best cryptocurrency websites and handpick only those with competitive prices we are aware that a majority of the best cryptocurrency website have adopted subscription or commissionbased business models hence it only made sense that we explore the price disparities of the best cryptocurrency websites offering similar services to help readers make the correct decisions with the information made available in our review sections you can get unadulterated access to the fee frameworks of listed crypto sites to ascertain that you are getting a fair bargain crypto ads some cryptocurrency websites provide crypto services for free in some rare cases the website owners rely on contributions to keep their systems running conversely most owners decide to integrate ads to generate revenue in light of this we try as much as possible to ensure that the user experience of websites is at an optimum regardless of the revenuegenerating model used by crypto sites to achieve this we always check to see that the users or visitors do not have to navigate a barrage of ads before they access the information or tools they want for us the lower the number of advertisements found on a website the easier it is for users to enjoy its features thus we often rank websites with little or no ads higher reputation it is common knowledge that reputation is one of the vital criteria for determining the competence of crypto developers and website administrators therefore we have set out to explore the track records of crypto sites and unearth incidents that can give readers a clear indication of the proficiency of their preferred crypto brands here we certify that websites have over the years responded appropriately to challenges inherently common in the crypto terrain as such we only showcase sites with good track records and that are trusted in the crypto landscape however this does not mean that we completely marginalize new cryptocurrency websites

this in mind we could not but help feature new promising sites loaded with impressive functionalities while new cryptocurrency websites lack the level of reputation synonymous with established brands they often feature on our lists because of the innovations they bring to the table security as you would expect security plays a pivotal role in our analysis users are always skeptical about subjecting their personal information funds and assets to thirdparty platforms especially when it involves cryptocurrency the precarious state of security in the crypto world has made it crucial for participants to investigate the security prowess of crypto entities before opting for their services as a result of this we carry out several security checks on each website featured on our review portal we ascertain that they utilize standard encryption protocols and implement effective identity verification systems security evaluations are particularly critical when reviewing platforms that impose kyc requirements or store crypto on behalf of their users customer support lastly we understand that many crypto website users are new to the terms governing crypto sites as well as their features and they will often require the help of representatives to navigate complex processes hence crypto sites must provide quality customer support systems to answer queries and resolve problems

coindesk market index coindesk market index features by jameson lopp apr at pm utc updated feb at pm utc from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledgers the cryptocurrency space is fast evolving to the point where it can be difficult to see in which direction its headed but were not without clues while many of the innovations in the space are new theyre built on decades of work that led to this point by tracing this history we can understand the motivations behind the movement that spawned bitcoin and share its vision for the future before the s cryptography was primarily practiced in secret by military or spy agencies but that changed when two publications brought it into the open the us government publication of the data encryption standard and the first publicly available work on publickey cryptography new directions in cryptography by dr whitfield diffie and dr martin hellman in the s dr david chaum wrote extensively on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems which he described in his paper security without identification transaction systems to make big brother obsolete over the next several years these ideas coalesced into a movement in late eric hughes timothy c may and john gilmore founded a small group that met monthly at gilmores company cygnus solutions in the san francisco bay area the group was humorously termed cypherpunks as a derivation of cipher and cyberpunk the cypherpunks mailing list was formed at about the same time and just a few months later eric hughes published a cypherpunks manifesto he wrote privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age privacy is not secrecy a private matter is something one doesnt want the whole world to know but a secret matter is something one doesnt want anybody to know privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world thats all good and well you may be thinking but im not a cypherpunk im not doing anything wrong i have nothing to hide as bruce schneier has noted the nothing to hide argument stems from a faulty premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong for example you likely have curtains over your windows so that people cant see into your home this isnt because you are undertaking illegal or immoral activities but simply because you dont wish to worry about the potential cost of revealing yourself to the outside world if youre reading this you have directly benefited from the efforts of cypherpunks some notable cypherpunks and their achievements jacob appelbaum tor developer julian assange founder of wikileaks dr adam back inventor of hashcash cofounder of blockstream bram cohen creator of bittorrent hal finney main author of pgp creator of reusable proof of work tim hudson coauthor of ssleay the precursor to openssl paul kocher coauthor of ssl moxie marlinspike founder of open whisper systems developer of signal steven schear creator of the concept of the warrant canary bruce schneier wellknown security author zooko wilcoxohearn digicash developer founder of zcash philip zimmermann creator of pgp this decade saw the rise of the crypto wars in which the us government attempted to stifle the spread of strong commercial encryption since the market for cryptography was almost entirely military up to this point encryption technology was included as a category xiii item into the us munitions list which had strict regulations preventing its export this limited export compatible ssl key length to bits which could be broken in a matter of days using a single personal computer legal challenges by civil libertarians and privacy advocates the widespread availability of encryption software outside the us and a successful attack by matt blaze against the governments proposed backdoor the clipper chip led the government to back down in dr adam back created hashcash which was designed as an antispam mechanism that would essentially add a time and computational cost to sending email thus making spam uneconomical he envisioned that hashcash would be easier for people to use than chaums digicash since there was no need for the creation of an account hashcash even had some protection against double spending later in  wei dai published a proposal for bmoney a practical way to enforce contractual agreements between anonymous actors he described two interesting concepts that should sound familiar first a protocol in which every participant maintains a separate database of how much money belongs to user secondly a variant of the first system where the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants who are incentivized to remain honest by putting their money on the line bitcoin uses the former concept while quite a few other cryptocurrencies have implemented a variant of the latter concept which we now call proof of stake its clear that cypherpunks had already been building on each others work for decades experimenting and laying the frameworks we needed in the s but a pivotal point was the creation of cypherpunk money in the s in hal finney created reusable proof of work rpow which built on backs hashcash rpows were unique cryptographic tokens that could only be used once much like unspent transaction outputs in bitcoin however validation and protection against double spending was still performed by a central server nick szabo published a proposal for bit gold in a digital collectible that built upon finneys rpow proposal however szabo did not propose a mechanism for limiting the total units of bit gold but rather envisioned that units would be valued differently based upon the amount of computational work performed to create them finally in satoshi nakamoto a pseudonym for a stillunidentified individual or individuals published the bitcoin whitepaper citing both hashcash and bmoney in fact satoshi emailed wei dai directly and mentioned that he learned about bmoney from dr back satoshi dedicated a section of the bitcoin whitepaper to privacy which reads the traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party the necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place by keeping public keys anonymous the public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else but without information linking the transaction to anyone this is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges where the time and size of individual trades the tape is made public but without telling who the parties were satoshi nakamoto triggered an avalanche of progress with a working system that people could use extend and fork bitcoin strengthened the entire cypherpunk movement by enabling organizations such as wikileaks to continue operating via bitcoin donations even after the traditional financial system had cut them off however as the bitcoin ecosystem has grown over the past few years privacy concerns seem to have been pushed to the backburner many early bitcoin users assumed that the system would give them complete anonymity but we have learned otherwise as various law enforcement agencies have revealed that they are able to deanonymize bitcoin users during investigations the open bitcoin privacy project has picked up some of the slack with regard to educating users about privacy and recommending best practices for bitcoin services the group is developing a threat model for attacks on bitcoin wallet privacy their model currently breaks attackers into several categories blockchain observers link different transactions together to the same identity by observing patterns in the flow of value network observers link different transactions and addresses together by observing activity on the peer to peer network physical adversaries try to find data on a wallet device in order to tamper with it or perform analysis upon it transaction participants create transactions that aid them in tracing and deanonymizing activity on the blockchain wallet providers may require personally identifiable information from users and then observe their transactions jonas nick at blockstream has also done a fair amount of research regarding privacy concerns for bitcoin users he has an excellent presentation in which he uncovers a number of privacy flaws some of which are devastating to spv bitcoin clients one of the greatest privacy issues in bitcoin is from blockchain observers because every transaction on the network is indefinitely public anyone in the present and future can be a potential adversary as a result one of the oldest recommended best practices is to never reuse a bitcoin address satoshi even made note of it in the bitcoin whitepaper as an additional firewall a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner some linking is still unavoidable with multiinput transactions which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner the risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner a multitude of systems and best practices have been developed in order to increase the privacy of bitcoin users dr pieter wuille authored bip hierarchical deterministic hd wallets which makes it much simpler for bitcoin wallets to manage addresses while privacy was not wuilles primary motivation hd wallets make it easier to avoid address reuse because the tech can easily generate new addresses as transactions flow into and out of the wallet elliptic curve diffiehellmanmerkle ecdhm addresses are bitcoin address schemes that increase privacy ecdhm addresses can be shared publicly and are used by senders and receivers to secretly derive traditional bitcoin addresses that blockchain observers cannot predict the result is that ecdhm addresses can be reused without the loss of privacy that usually occurs from traditional bitcoin address reuse some examples of ecdhm address schemes include stealth addresses by peter todd bip reusable payment codes by justus ranvier and bip out of band address exchange by justin newton and others bitcoin mixing is a more labor intensive method by which users can increase their privacy the concept of mixing coins with other participants is similar to the concept of mix networks invented by dr chaum several different mixing algorithms have been developed coinjoin blockstream cofounder gregory maxwells original proposal for mixing coins coinjoin essentially lets users create a transaction with many inputs from multiple people and then send the coins to many other outputs that pay back to the same people thus mixing the values together and making it difficult to tell which inputs are related to which outputs caption id alignaligncenter width example of a naïve coinjoin transactioncaption joinmarket built by developer chris belcher joinmarket enables holders of bitcoin to allow their coins to be mixed via coinjoin with other users coins in return for a fee it uses a kind of smart contract so that your private keys never leave your computer thus reducing the risk of loss put simply joinmarket allows you to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions for low fees in a decentralized fashion coinshuffle a decentralized mixing protocol developed by a group of researchers at saarland university in germany coinshuffle improves upon coinjoin it does not require a trusted third party to assemble the mixing transactions and thus does not require additional mixing fees coinswap another concept developed by maxwell coinswap is substantially different from coinjoin in that it uses a series of four multisig transactions two escrow payments two escrow releases to trustlessly swap coins between two parties it is much less efficient than coinjoin but can potentially offer much greater privacy even facilitating the swapping of coins between different blockchains while mixing is tantamount to hiding in a crowd often the crowd is not particularly large mixing should be considered as providing obfuscation rather than complete anonymity because it makes it difficult for casual observers to trace the flow of funds but more sophisticated observers may still be able to deobfuscate the mixing transactions kristov atlas founder of the open bitcoin privacy project posted his findings on weaknesses in improperly implemented coinjoin clients back in atlas noted that even with a fairly primitive analysis tool he was able to group of inputs and of a single coinjoin transactions outputs there are even separate cryptocurrencies that have been developed with privacy in mind one example is dash designed by evan duffield and daniel diaz which has a feature called darksend   an improved version of coinjoin the two major improvements are the value amounts used and frequency of mixing dashs mixing uses common denominations of dash dash dash and dash in order to make grouping of inputs and outputs much more difficult in each mixing session users submit the same denominations as inputs and outputs to maximize the privacy offered by mixing and make timing attacks more difficult darksend runs automatically at set intervals another privacyfocused cryptocurrency is not even based on bitcoin the cryptonote whitepaper was released in by nicolas van saberhagen and the concept has been implemented in several cryptocurrencies such as monero the primary innovations are cryptographic ring signatures and unique onetime keys regular digital signatures such as those used in bitcoin involve a single pair of keys one public and one private this allows the owner of a public address to prove that they own it by signing a spend of funds with the corresponding private key screen shot at pm ring signatures were first proposed in httpdownloadspringercomstaticpdfchpaf_pdforiginurlhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_tokenexpaclfstaticfpdfffchpaf_pdfforiginurldhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_hmacceddecafefcaabfbfbeafcecda by dr adi

httpdownloadspringercomstaticpdfchpaf_pdforiginurlhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_tokenexpaclfstaticfpdfffchpaf_pdfforiginurldhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_hmacceaddddaefaffbafcbaffecac by dr chaum and eugene van heyst ring signatures involve a group of individuals each with their own private and public key the statement proved by a ring signature is that the signer of a given message is a member of the group the main distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes is that the signer needs a single secret key but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of the signer therefore if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys of alice bob and carol you can only claim that one of these individuals was the signer but you will not be able to know exactly to whom the transaction belongs it provides another level of obfuscation that makes it more difficult for blockchain observers to track the ownership of payments as they flow through the system interesting enough ring signatures were developed specifically in the context of whistleblowing as they enable the anonymous leaking of secrets while still proving that the source of the secrets is reputable an individual who is part of a known group cryptonote is also designed to mitigate the risks associated with key reuse and inputtooutput tracing every address for a payment is a unique onetime key derived from both the senders and the recipients data as soon as you use a ring signature in your input it adds more uncertainty as to which output has just been spent if a blockchain observer tries to draw a graph with used addresses connecting them via the transactions on the blockchain it will be a tree because no address was used twice the number of possible graphs rises exponentially as you add more transactions to the graph since every ring signature produces ambiguity as to how the value flowed between the addresses thus you cant be certain of which address sent funds to another address depending on the size of the ring used for signing the ambiguity for a single transaction can vary from one out of two to one out of every transaction increases the entropy and creates additional difficulty for a blockchain observer while there are still many privacy concerns for cryptocurrency users the future is bright due to the ongoing work of cypherpunks the next leap forward in privacy will involve the use of zeroknowledge proofs which were first proposed in in order to broaden the potential applications of cryptographic protocols originally proposed by dr back in as bitcoins with homomorphic value maxwell has been working on confidential transactions which use zeroknowledge range proofs to enable the creation of bitcoin transactions in which the values are hidden from everyone except the transaction participants this is a great improvement on its own but when you combine confidential transactions with coinjoin then you can build a mixing service that severs any links between transaction inputs and outputs when maxwell presented sidechain elements at the san francisco bitcoin devs meetup i recall him saying one of the greatest regrets held by the greybeards at the ietf is that the internet was not built with encryption as the default method of transmitting data maxwell clearly feels the same way about privacy in bitcoin and wishes that we had confidential transactions from the very beginning we have already seen blockstream implement confidential transactions within the liquid sidechain in order to mask transfers between exchanges we also recently saw maxwell conduct the first successful zeroknowledge contingent payment on the bitcoin network zkcp is a transaction protocol that allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using bitcoin in a trustless manner the purchased information is only transferred if the payment is made and it is guaranteed to be transferred if the payment is made the buyer and seller do not need to trust each other or depend on arbitration by a third party i wrote about zerocoin several years ago and noted the technical challenges that it needed to overcome before the system could be useable since then researchers have managed to make the proofs much more efficient and have solved the trust problem with the initial generation of the system parameters we are now on the cusp of seeing zerocoins vision realized with the release of zcash headed by wilcoxohearn zcash offers total payment confidentiality while still maintaining a decentralized network using a public blockchain zcash transactions automatically hide the sender recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain only those with the correct view key can see the contents of a transaction since the contents of zcash transactions are encrypted and private the system uses a novel cryptographic method to verify payments zcash uses a zeroknowledge proof construction called a zksnark developed by its team of experienced cryptographers instead of publicly demonstrating spendauthority and transaction values the transaction metadata is encrypted and zksnarks are used to prove that the transaction is valid zcash may very well be the first digital payment system that enables foolproof anonymity in the decades since the cypherpunks set forth on their quest computer technology has advanced to the point where individuals and groups can communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner two persons may exchange messages conduct business and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name or legal identity of the other it is only natural that governments will try to slow or halt the spread of this technology citing national security concerns use of the technology by criminals and fears of societal disintegration cypherpunks know that we must defend our privacy if we expect to have any people have been defending their privacy for centuries with whispers darkness envelopes closed doors secret handshakes and couriers prior to the th century technology did not enable strong privacy but neither did it enable affordable mass surveillance we now live in a world where surveillance is to be expected but privacy is not even though privacy enhancing technologies exist we have entered a phase that many are calling the crypto wars although the cypherpunks emerged victorious from the first crypto wars we cannot afford to rest upon our laurels zooko has experienced the failure of cypherpunk projects in the past and he warns httpsepicenterbitcoincompodcast that failure is still possible cypherpunks believe that privacy is a fundamental human right including privacy from governments they understand that the weakening of a systems security for any reason including access by trusted authorities makes the system insecure for everyone who uses it cypherpunks write code they know that someone has to write software to defend privacy and thus they take up the task they publish their code so that fellow cypherpunks may learn from it attack it and improve upon it their code is free for anyone to use cypherpunks dont care if you dont approve of the software they write they know that software cant be destroyed and that widely dispersed systems cant be shut down thanks to kristov atlas and jonas nick for reviewing and

wikidata item printexport download as pdf printable version from wikipedia the free encyclopedia history of bitcoin a cryptocurrency number of bitcoin transactions per month logarithmic scale bitcoin is a cryptocurrency a digital asset that uses cryptography to control its creation and management rather than relying on central authorities originally designed as a medium of exchange bitcoin is now primarily regarded as a store of value the history of bitcoin started with its invention and implementation by satoshi nakamoto who integrated many existing ideas from the cryptography community over the course of bitcoins history it has undergone rapid growth to become a significant store of value both on and offline from the mids some businesses began accepting bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies background edit prior to the release of bitcoin there were a number of digital cash technologies starting with the issuerbased ecash protocols of david chaum and stefan brands the idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers cynthia dwork and moni naor in the idea was independently rediscovered by adam back who developed hashcash a proofofwork scheme for spam control in the first proposals for distributed digital scarcitybased cryptocurrencies were wei dai s bmoney and nick szabo s bit gold hal finney developed reusable proof of work rpow using hashcash as its proof of work algorithm in the bit gold proposal which proposed a collectible marketbased mechanism for inflation control nick szabo also investigated some additional aspects including a byzantine faulttolerant agreement protocol based on quorum addresses to store and transfer the chained proofofwork solutions which was vulnerable to sybil attacks though can bitcoin profitable for now  creation edit on the th of august the domain name bitcoinorg was registered later that year on october a link to a paper authored by satoshi nakamoto titled bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system was posted to a cryptography mailing list this paper detailed methods of using a peertopeer network to generate what was described as a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust on january the bitcoin network came into existence with satoshi nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin block number which had a reward of bitcoins embedded in the genesis block was the text the times jan chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks the text refers to a headline in the times published on january this note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractionalreserve banking   the first open source bitcoin client was released on january hosted at sourceforge one of the first supporters adopters contributors to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer hal finney finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released and received bitcoins from nakamoto in the worlds first bitcoin transaction on january bloc other early supporters were wei dai creator of bitcoin predecessor bmoney and nick szabo creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold in the early days nakamoto is estimated to have mined million bitcoins before disappearing from any involvement in bitcoin nakamoto in a sense handed over the reins to developer gavin andresen who then became the bitcoin lead developer at the bitcoin foundation the anarchic bitcoin communitys closest thing to an official public face satoshi nakamoto edit main article satoshi nakamoto satoshi nakamoto is presumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in and launched the network in nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the bitcoin forum there has been much speculation as to the identity of satoshi nakamoto with suspects including dai szabo and finney  and accompanying denials the possibility that satoshi nakamoto was a computer collective in the european financial sector has also been discussed investigations into the real identity of satoshi nakamoto were attempted by the new yorker and fast company the new yorkers investigation brought up at least two possible candidates michael clear and vili lehdonvirta fast company s investigation brought up circumstantial evidence linking an encryption patent application filed by neal king vladimir oksman and charles bry on august and the bitcoinorg domain name which was registered  hours later the patent application contained networking and encryption technologies similar to bitcoins and textual analysis revealed that the phrase  computationally impractical to reverse appeared in both the patent application and bitcoins whitepaper all three inventors explicitly denied being satoshi nakamoto in may ted nelson speculated that japanese mathematician shinichi mochizuki is satoshi nakamoto later in the israeli researchers dorit ron and adi shamir pointed to silk roadlinked ross william ulbricht as the possible person behind the cover the two researchers based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions these allegations were contested and ron and shamir later retracted their claim nakamotos involvement with bitcoin does not appear to extend past mid in april nakamoto communicated with a bitcoin contributor saying that he had moved on to other things stefan thomas a swiss coder and active community member graphed the time stamps for each of nakamotos plus bitcoin forum posts the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of  am and  am greenwich mean time because this pattern held true even on saturdays and sundays it suggested that nakamoto was asleep at this time and the hours of  am to  am gmt are midnight to  am eastern standard time north american eastern standard time other clues suggested that nakamoto was british a newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the ukpublished newspaper the times and both his forum posts and his comments in the bitcoin source code used british english spellings such as optimise and colour an internet search by an anonymous blogger of texts similar in writing to the bitcoin whitepaper suggests nick szabo s bit gold articles as having a similar author nick denied being satoshi and stated his official opinion on satoshi and bitcoin in a may article in a march article in newsweek journalist leah mcgrath goodman doxed dorian s nakamoto of temple city california saying that satoshi nakamoto is the mans birth name her methods and conclusion drew widespread criticism in june the london review of books published a piece by andrew ohagan about nakamoto after a may youtube documentary pointed to adam back as the creator of bitcoin widespread discussion ensued the real identity of satoshi nakamoto still remains a matter of dispute growth edit edit the first notable retail transaction involving physical goods was paid on may by exchanging mined btc for two pizzas delivered from a local pizza restaurant in florida marking may as the bitcoin pizza day for cryptofans at the time a transactions value was typically negotiated on the bitcoin forum citation needed on august a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted while the protocol did verify that a transactions outputs never exceeded its inputs a transaction whose outputs summed to more than displaystyle would overflow permitting the transaction author to create arbitrary amounts of bitcoin on august the vulnerability was exploited a single transaction spent bitcoin to send just over billion bitcoins displaystyle satoshis to each of two different addresses on the network within hours the transaction was spotted the bug was fixed and the blockchain was forked by miners using an updated version of the bitcoin protocol since the blockchain was forked below the problematic transaction the transaction no longer appears in the blockchain used by the bitcoin network today this was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoins history edit based on bitcoins opensource code other cryptocurrencies started to emerge the electronic frontier foundation a nonprofit group started accepting bitcoins in january then stopped accepting them in june citing concerns about a lack of legal precedent about new currency systems the effs decision was reversed on may when they resumed accepting bitcoin in may bitcoin payment processor bitpay was founded to provide mobile checkout services to companies wanting to accept bitcoins as a form of payment in june wikileaks and other organizations began to accept bitcoins for donations edit in january bitcoin was featured as the main subject within a fictionalized trial on the cbs legal drama the good wife in the thirdseason episode bitcoin for dummies the host of cnbc s mad money jim cramer played himself in a courtroom scene where he testifies that he doesnt consider bitcoin a true currency saying theres no central bank to regulate it its digital and functions completely peer to peer in september the bitcoin foundation was launched to accelerate the global growth of bitcoin through standardization

million worth of bitcoins in a single month at over per bitcoin the internet archive announced that it was ready to accept donations as bitcoins and that it intends to give employees the option to receive portions of their salaries in bitcoin currency in march the bitcoin transaction log called the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with differing rules on how transactions were accepted for six hours two bitcoin networks operated at the same time each with its own version of the transaction history the core developers called for a temporary halt to transactions sparking a sharp selloff normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version of the bitcoin software the mt gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the exchange rate briefly dipped by to as the event occurred before recovering to previous level of approximately in the following hours in the us the financial crimes enforcement network fincen established regulatory guidelines for decentralized virtual currencies such as bitcoin classifying american bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as money service businesses or msbs that may be subject to registration and other legal obligations in april payment processors bitinstant and mt gox experienced processing delays due to insufficient capacity resulting in the bitcoin exchange rate dropping from to before returning to within six hours bitcoin gained greater recognition when services such as okcupid and foodler began accepting it for payment in april eric posner a law professor at the university of chicago stated that a real ponzi scheme takes fraud bitcoin by contrast seems more like a collective delusion on may the us authorities seized accounts associated with mt gox after discovering that it had not registered as a money transmitter with fincen in the us on may it was reported that bitinstant processed approximately percent of the money going into and out of bitcoin and in april alone facilitated transactions on june it was reported that the us drug enforcement administration listed bitcoins as a seized asset in a united states department of justice seizure notice pursuant to usc this was the first time a government agency was reported to have seized bitcoin in july a project began in kenya linking bitcoin with mpesa a popular mobile payments system in an experiment designed to spur innovative payments in africa during the same month the foreign exchange administration and policy department in thailand stated that bitcoin lacks any legal framework and would therefore be illegal which effectively banned trading on bitcoin exchanges in the country on august federal judge amos mazzant of the eastern district of texas of the fifth circuit ruled that bitcoins are a currency or a form of money specifically securities as defined by federal securities laws and as such were subject to the courts jurisdiction and germanys finance ministry subsumed bitcoins under the term unit of account  a financial instrument  though not as emoney or a functional currency a classification nonetheless having legal and tax implications in october the fbi seized roughly  btc from website silk road during the arrest of alleged owner ross william ulbricht two companies robocoin and bitcoiniacs launched the worlds first bitcoin atm on october in vancouver bc canada allowing clients to sell or purchase bitcoin currency at a downtown coffee shop chinese internet giant baidu had allowed clients of website security services to pay with bitcoins in november

and list of bitcoin forks a fork referring to a blockchain is defined variously as a blockchain split into two paths forward or as a change of protocol rules accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process they happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time as a result the network briefly forks this fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain that were dropped by the longer chain march edit on march a bitcoin miner running version of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions this created a split or fork in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block this split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain in response the mt gox exchange temporarily halted bitcoin deposits the exchange rate fell to on the mt gox exchange but rose most of the way back to its prior level of miners resolved the split by downgrading to version putting them back on track with the canonical blockchain user funds largely remained unaffected and were available when network consensus was restored the network reached consensus and continued to operate as normal a few hours after the split august edit two significant forks took place in august one bitcoin cash is a hard fork off the main chain in opposition to the other which is a soft fork to implement segregated witness regulatory issues edit on march the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen a bureau of the united states department of the treasury issued a report regarding centralized and decentralized virtual currencies and their legal status within money services business msb and bank secrecy act regulations it classified digital currencies and other digital payment systems such as bitcoin as virtual currencies because they are not legal tender under any sovereign jurisdiction fincen cleared american users of bitcoin of legal obligations by saying a user of virtual currency is not an msb under fincens regulations and therefore is not subject to msb registration reporting and recordkeeping regulations however it held that american entities who generate virtual currency such as bitcoins are money transmitters or msbs if they sell their generated currency for national currency a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter this specifically extends to miners of the bitcoin currency who may have to register as msbs and abide by the legal requirements of being a money transmitter if they sell their generated bitcoins for national currency and are within the united states since fincen issued this guidance dozens of virtual currency exchangers and administrators have registered with fincen and fincen is receiving an increasing number of suspicious activity reports sars from these entities additionally fincen claimed regulation over american entities that manage bitcoins in a payment processor setting or as an exchanger in addition a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such decentralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency funds or other value that substitutes for currency in summary fincens decision would require bitcoin exchanges where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies to disclose large transactions and suspicious activity comply with money laundering regulations and collect information about their customers as traditional financial institutions are required to do jennifer shasky calvery the director of fincen said virtual currencies are subject to the same rules as other currencies basic moneyservices business rules apply here in its october study virtual currency schemes the european central bank concluded that the growth of virtual currencies will continue and given the currencies inherent price instability lack of close regulation and risk of illegal uses by anonymous users the bank warned that periodic examination of developments would be necessary to reassess risks in the us treasury extended its antimoney laundering regulations to processors of bitcoin transactions in june bitcoin foundation board member jon matonis wrote in forbes that he received a warning letter from the california department of financial institutions accusing the foundation of unlicensed money transmission matonis denied that the foundation is engaged in money transmission and said he viewed the case as an opportunity to educate state regulators in late july the industry group committee for the establishment of the digital asset transfer authority began to form to set best practices and standards to work with regulators and policymakers to adapt existing currency requirements to digital currency technology and business models and develop risk management standards in the us securities and exchange commission filed an administrative action against erik t voorhees for violating securities act section for publicly offering unregistered interests in two bitcoin websites in exchange for bitcoins by december bitcoin futures contracts began to be offered and the us chicago board options exchange cboe was formally settling the futures daily by multiple trading companies were offering services around bitcoin futures bitcoin faucets edit a bitcoin faucet is a reward system in the form of a website or software app that dispenses rewards in the form of a satoshi which is worth a hundredth of a millionth btc for visitors to claim in exchange for completing a captcha or task as described by the website there are also faucets that dispense alternative cryptocurrencies the first bitcoin faucet was called the bitcoin faucet and was developed by gavin andresen in it originally gave out five bitcoins per person the rewards are dispensed at various predetermined intervals of time as rewards for completing simple tasks such as captcha completion and as prizes from simple games faucets usually give fractions of a bitcoin but the amount will typically fluctuate according to the value of bitcoin some faucets also have random larger rewards to reduce mining fees faucets normally save up these small individual payments in their own ledgers which then add up to make a larger payment that is sent to a users bitcoin address because bitcoin transactions are irreversible and there are many faucets they have become targets for hackers interested in stealing bitcoins advertisements are the main income source of bitcoin faucets faucets try to get traffic from users by offering free bitcoin as an incentive some ad networks also pay directly in bitcoin this means that faucets often have a low profit margin some faucets also make money by mining altcoins in the background using the users cpu theft and exchange shutdowns edit bitcoins can be stored in a bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet theft of bitcoin has been

https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/,how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddihow the bitcoin protocol actually works first steps a signed letter of intent using serial numbers to make coins uniquely identifiable making everyone collectively the bank proofofwork problems for the author bitcoin transactions with multiple inputs and outputs conclusion footnote comments post navigationskip to content ddi datadriven intelligence many thousands of articles have been written purporting to explain bitcoin the online peertopeer currency most of those articles give a handwavy account of the underlying cryptographic protocol omitting many details even those articles which delve deeper often gloss over crucial points my aim in this post is to explain the major ideas behind the bitcoin protocol in a clear easily comprehensible way well start from first principles build up to a broad theoretical understanding of how the protocol works and then dig down into the nittygritty examining the raw data in a bitcoin transaction understanding the protocol in this detailed way is hard work it is tempting instead to take bitcoin as given and to engage in speculation about how to get rich with bitcoin whether bitcoin is a bubble whether bitcoin might one day mean the end of taxation and so on thats fun but severely limits your understanding understanding the details of the bitcoin protocol opens up otherwise inaccessible vistas in particular its the basis for understanding bitcoins builtin scripting language which makes it possible to use bitcoin to create new types of financial instruments such as smart contracts new financial instruments can in turn be used to create new markets and to enable new forms of collective human behaviour talk about fun ill describe bitcoin scripting and concepts such as smart contracts in future posts this post concentrates on explaining the nutsandbolts of the bitcoin protocol to understand the post you need to be comfortable with public key cryptography and with the closely related idea of digital signatures ill also assume youre familiar with cryptographic hashing none of this is especially difficult the basic ideas can be taught in freshman university mathematics or computer science classes the ideas are beautiful so if youre not familiar with them i recommend taking a few hours to get familiar it may seem surprising that bitcoins basis is cryptography isnt bitcoin a currency not a way of sending secret messages in fact the problems bitcoin needs to solve are largely about securing transactions making sure people cant steal from one another or impersonate one another and so on in the world of atoms we achieve security with devices such as locks safes signatures and bank vaults in the world of bits we achieve this kind of security with cryptography and thats why bitcoin is at heart a cryptographic protocol my strategy in the post is to build bitcoin up in stages ill begin by explaining a very simple digital currency based on ideas that are almost obvious well call that currency infocoin to distinguish it from bitcoin of course our first version of infocoin will have many deficiencies and so well go through several iterations of infocoin with each iteration introducing just one or two simple new ideas after several such iterations well arrive at the full bitcoin protocol we will have reinvented bitcoin this strategy is slower than if i explained the entire bitcoin protocol in one shot but while you can understand the mechanics of bitcoin through such a oneshot explanation it would be difficult to understand why bitcoin is designed the way it is the advantage of the slower iterative explanation is that it gives us a much sharper understanding of each element of bitcoin finally i should mention that im a relative newcomer to bitcoin ive been following it loosely since and cryptocurrencies since the late s but only got seriously into the details of the bitcoin protocol earlier this year so id certainly appreciate corrections of any misapprehensions on my part also in the post ive included a number of problems for the author notes to myself about questions that came up during the writing you may find these interesting but you can also skip them entirely without losing track of the main text so how can we design a digital currency on the face of it a digital currency sounds impossible suppose some person lets call her alice has some digital money which she wants to spend if alice can use a string of bits as money how can we prevent her from using the same bit string over and over thus minting an infinite supply of money or if we can somehow solve that problem how can we prevent someone else forging such a string of bits and using that to steal from alice these are just two of the many problems that must be overcome in order to use information as money as a first version of infocoin lets find a way that alice can use a string of bits as a very primitive and incomplete form of money in a way that gives her at least some protection against forgery suppose alice wants to give another person bob an infocoin to do this alice writes down the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin she then digitally signs the message using a private cryptographic key and announces the signed string of bits to the entire world by the way im using capitalized infocoin to refer to the protocol and general concept and lowercase infocoin to refer to specific denominations of the currency a similar useage is common though not universal in the bitcoin world this isnt terribly impressive as a prototype digital currency but it does have some virtues anyone in the world including bob can use alices public key to verify that alice really was the person who signed the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin noone else could have created that bit string and so alice cant turn around and say no i didnt mean to give bob an infocoin so the protocol establishes that alice truly intends to give bob one infocoin the same fact noone else could compose such a signed message also gives alice some limited protection from forgery of course after alice has published her message its possible for other people to duplicate the message so in that sense forgery is possible but its not possible from scratch these two properties establishment of intent on alices part and the limited protection from forgery are genuinely notable features of this protocol i havent quite said exactly what digital money is in this protocol to make this explicit its just the message itself ie the string of bits representing the digitally signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin later protocols will be similar in that all our forms of digital money will be just more and more elaborate messages a problem with the first version of infocoin is that alice could keep sending bob the same signed message over and over suppose bob receives ten copies of the signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin does that mean alice sent bob ten different infocoins was her message accidentally duplicated perhaps she was trying to trick bob into believing that she had given him ten different infocoins when the message only proves to the world that she intends to transfer one infocoin what wed like is a way of making infocoins unique they need a label or serial number alice would sign the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number then later alice could sign the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and bob and everyone else would know that a different infocoin was being transferred to make this scheme work we need a trusted source of serial numbers for the infocoins one way to create such a source is to introduce a bank this bank would provide serial numbers for infocoins keep track of who has which infocoins and verify that transactions really are legitimate in more detail lets suppose alice goes into the bank and says i want to withdraw one infocoin from my account the bank reduces her account balance by one infocoin and assigns her a new neverbefore used serial number lets say then when alice wants to transfer her infocoin to bob she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number but bob doesnt just accept the infocoin instead he contacts the bank and verifies that a the infocoin with that serial number belongs to alice and b alice hasnt already spent the infocoin if both those things are true then bob tells the bank he wants to accept the infocoin and the bank updates their records to show that the infocoin with that serial number is now in bobs possession and no longer belongs to alice this last solution looks pretty promising however it turns out that we can do something much more ambitious we can eliminate the bank entirely from the protocol this changes the nature of the currency considerably it means that there is no longer any single organization in charge of the currency and when you think about the enormous power a central bank has control over the money supply thats a pretty huge change the idea is to make it so everyone collectively is the bank in particular well assume that everyone using infocoin keeps a complete record of which infocoins belong to which person you can think of this as a shared public ledger showing all infocoin transactions well call this ledger the block chain since thats what the complete record will be called in bitcoin once we get to it now suppose alice wants to transfer an infocoin to bob she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and gives the signed message to bob bob can use his copy of the block chain to check that indeed the infocoin is alices to give if that checks out then he broadcasts both alices message and his acceptance of the transaction to the entire network and everyone updates their copy of the block chain we still have the where do serial number come from problem but that turns out to be pretty easy to solve and so i will defer it to later in the discussion of bitcoin a more challenging problem is that this protocol allows alice to cheat by double spending her infocoin she sends the signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number to bob and the messagei alice am giving charlie one infocoin with the same serial number to charlie both bob and charlie use their copy of the block chain to verify that the infocoin is alices to spend provided they do this verification at nearly the same time before theyve had a chance to hear from one another both will find that yes the block chain shows the coin belongs to alice and so they will both accept the transaction and also broadcast their acceptance of the transaction now theres a problem how should other people update their block chains there may be no easy way to achieve a consistent shared ledger of transactions and even if everyone can agree on a consistent way to update their block chains there is still the problem that either bob or charlie will be cheated at first glance double spending seems difficult for alice to pull off after all if alice sends the message first to bob then bob can verify the message and tell everyone else in the network including charlie to update their block chain once that has happened charlie would no longer be fooled by alice so there is most likely only a brief period of time in which alice can double spend however its obviously undesirable to have any such a period of time worse there are techniques alice could use to make that period longer she could for example use network traffic analysis to find times when bob and charlie are likely to have a lot of latency in communication or perhaps she could do something to deliberately disrupt their communications if she can slow communication even a little that makes her task of double spending much easier how can we address the problem of double spending the obvious solution is that when alice sends bob an infocoin bob shouldnt try to verify the transaction alone rather he should broadcast the possible transaction to the entire network of infocoin users and ask them to help determine whether the transaction is legitimate if they collectively decide that the transaction is okay then bob can accept the infocoin and everyone will update their block chain this type of protocol can help prevent double spending since if alice tries to spend her infocoin with both bob and charlie other people on the network will notice and network users will tell both bob and charlie that there is a problem with the transaction and the transaction shouldnt go through in more detail lets suppose alice wants to give bob an infocoin as before she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and gives the signed message to bob also as before bob does a sanity check using his copy of the block chain to check that indeed the coin currently belongs to alice but at that point the protocol is modified bob doesnt just go ahead and accept the transaction instead he broadcasts alices message to the entire network other members of the network check to see whether alice owns that infocoin if so they broadcast the message yes alice owns infocoin it can now be transferred to bob once enough people have broadcast that message everyone updates their block chain to show that infocoin now belongs to bob and the transaction is complete this protocol has many imprecise elements at present for instance what does it mean to say once enough people have broadcast that message what exactly does enough mean here it cant mean everyone in the network since we dont a priori know who is on the infocoin network for the same reason it cant mean some fixed fraction of users in the network we wont try to make these ideas precise right now instead in the next section ill point out a serious problem with the approach as described fixing that problem will at the same time have the pleasant side effect of making the ideas above much more precise suppose alice wants to double spend in the networkbased protocol i just described she could do this by taking over the infocoin network lets suppose she uses an automated system to set up a large number of separate identities lets say a billion on the infocoin network as before she tries to double spend the same infocoin with both bob and charlie but when bob and charlie ask the network to validate their respective transactions alices sock puppet identities swamp the network announcing to bob that theyve validated his transaction and to charlie that theyve validated his transaction possibly fooling one or both into accepting the transaction theres a clever way of avoiding this problem using an idea known as proofofwork the idea is counterintuitive and involves a combination of two ideas to artificially make it computationally costly for network users to validate transactions and to reward them for trying to help validate transactions the reward is used so that people on the network will try to help validate transactions even though thats now been made a computationally costly process the benefit of making it costly to validate transactions is that validation can no longer be influenced by the number of network identities someone controls but only by the total computational power they can bring to bear on validation as well see with some clever design we can make it so a cheater would need enormous computational resources to cheat making it impractical thats the gist of proofofwork but to really understand proofofwork we need to go through the details suppose alice broadcasts to the network the news that i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number as other people on the network hear that message each adds it to a queue of pending transactions that theyve been told about but which havent yet been approved by the network for instance another network user named david might have the following queue of pending transactions i tom am giving sue one infocoin with serial number i sydney am giving cynthia one infocoin with serial number i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number david checks his copy of the block chain and can see that each transaction is valid he would like to help out by broadcasting news of that validity to the entire network however before doing that as part of the validation protocol david is required to solve a hard computational puzzle the proofofwork without the solution to that puzzle the rest of the network wont accept his validation of the transaction what puzzle does david need to solve to explain that let be a fixed hash function known by everyone in the network its built into the protocol bitcoin uses the wellknown sha hash function but any cryptographically secure hash function will do lets give davids queue of pending transactions a label just so its got a name we can refer to suppose david appends a number called the nonce to and hashes the combination for example if we use hello world obviously this is not a list of transactions just a string used for illustrative purposes and the nonce then output is in hexadecimal hhello world afcfdaadceecaaceceecc the puzzle david has to solve the proofofwork is to find a nonce such that when we append to and hash the combination the output hash begins with a long run of zeroes the puzzle can be made more or less difficult by varying the number of zeroes required to solve the puzzle a relatively simple proofofwork puzzle might require just three or four zeroes at the start of the hash while a more difficult proofofwork puzzle might require a much longer run of zeros say consecutive zeroes in either case the above attempt to find a suitable nonce with is a failure since the output doesnt begin with any zeroes at all trying doesnt work either hhello world eafcbefabdcdadeeefbeeaad we can keep trying different values for the nonce finally at we obtain hhello world caffcffdcfaffadfcceaedcde this nonce gives us a string of four zeroes at the beginning of the output of the hash this will be enough to solve a simple proofofwork puzzle but not enough to solve a more difficult proofofwork puzzle what makes this puzzle hard to solve is the fact that the output from a cryptographic hash function behaves like a random number change the input even a tiny bit and the output from the hash function changes completely in a way thats hard to predict so if we want the output hash value to begin with zeroes say then david will need on average to try different values for before he finds a suitable nonce thats a pretty challenging task requiring lots of computational power obviously its possible to make this puzzle more or less difficult to solve by requiring more or fewer zeroes in the output from the hash function in fact the bitcoin protocol gets quite a fine level of control over the difficulty of the puzzle by using a slight variation on the proofofwork puzzle described above instead of requiring leading zeroes the bitcoin proofofwork puzzle requires the hash of a blocks header to be lower than or equal to a number known as the target this target is automatically adjusted to ensure that a bitcoin block takes on average about ten minutes to validate in practice there is a sizeable randomness in how long it takes to validate a block sometimes a new block is validated in just a minute or two other times it may take minutes or even longer its straightforward to modify the bitcoin protocol so that the time to validation is much more sharply peaked around ten minutes instead of solving a single puzzle we can require that multiple puzzles be solved with some careful design it is possible to considerably reduce the variance in the time to validate a block of transactions alright lets suppose david is lucky and finds a suitable nonce celebration hell be rewarded for finding the nonce as described below he broadcasts the block of transactions hes approving to the network together with the value for other participants in the infocoin network can verify that is a valid solution to the proofofwork puzzle and they then update their block chains to include the new block of transactions for the proofofwork idea to have any chance of succeeding network users need an incentive to help validate transactions without such an incentive they have no reason to expend valuable computational power merely to help validate other peoples transactions and if network users are not willing to expend that power then the whole system wont work the solution to this problem is to reward people who help validate transactions in particular suppose we reward whoever successfully validates a block of transactions by crediting them with some infocoins provided the infocoin reward is large enough that will give them an incentive to participate in validation in the bitcoin protocol this validation process is called mining for each block of transactions validated the successful miner receives a bitcoin reward initially this was set to be a bitcoin reward but for every validated blocks roughly once every four years the reward halves this has happened just once to date and so the current reward for mining a block is bitcoins this halving in the rate will continue every four years until the year ce at that point the reward for mining will drop below bitcoins per block bitcoins is actually the minimal unit of bitcoin and is known as a satoshi so in ce the total supply of bitcoins will cease to increase however that wont eliminate the incentive to help validate transactions bitcoin also makes it possible to set aside some currency in a transaction as a transaction fee which goes to the miner who helps validate it in the early days of bitcoin transaction fees were mostly set to zero but as bitcoin has gained in popularity transaction fees have gradually risen and are now a substantial additional incentive on top of the bitcoin reward for mining a block you can think of proofofwork as a competition to approve transactions each entry in the competition costs a little bit of computing power a miners chance of winning the competition is roughly and with some caveats equal to the proportion of the total computing power that they control so for instance if a miner controls one percent of the computing power being used to validate bitcoin transactions then they have roughly a one percent chance of winning the competition so provided a lot of computing power is being brought to bear on the competition a dishonest miner is likely to have only a relatively small chance to corrupt the validation process unless they expend a huge amount of computing resources of course while its encouraging that a dishonest party has only a relatively small chance to corrupt the block chain thats not enough to give us confidence in the currency in particular we havent yet conclusively addressed the issue of double spending ill analyse double spending shortly before doing that i want to fill in an important detail in the description of infocoin wed ideally like the infocoin network to agree upon the order in which transactions have occurred if we dont have such an ordering then at any given moment it may not be clear who owns which infocoins to help do this well require that new blocks always include a pointer to the last block validated in the chain in addition to the list of transactions in the block the pointer is actually just a hash of the previous block so typically the block chain is just a linear chain of blocks of transactions one after the other with later blocks each containing a pointer to the immediately prior block occasionally a fork will appear in the block chain this can happen for instance if by chance two miners happen to validate a block of transactions nearsimultaneously both broadcast their newlyvalidated block out to the network and some people update their block chain one way and others update their block chain the other way this causes exactly the problem were trying to avoid its no longer clear in what order transactions have occurred and it may not be clear who owns which infocoins fortunately theres a simple idea that can be used to remove any forks the rule is this if a fork occurs people on the network keep track of both forks but at any given time miners only work to extend whichever fork is longest in their copy of the block chain suppose for example that we have a fork in which some miners receive block a first and some miners receive block b first those miners who receive block a first will continue mining along that fork while the others will mine along fork b lets suppose that the miners working on fork b are the next to successfully mine a block after they receive news that this has happened the miners working on fork a will notice that fork b is now longer and will switch to working on that fork presto in short order work on fork a will cease and everyone will be working on the same linear chain and block a can be ignored of course any stillpending transactions in a will still be pending in the queues of the miners working on fork b and so all transactions will eventually be validated likewise it may be that the miners working on fork a are the first to extend their fork in that case work on fork b will quickly cease and again we have a single linear chain no matter what the outcome this process ensures that the block chain has an agreedupon time ordering of the blocks in bitcoin proper a transaction is not considered confirmed until it is part of a block in the longest fork and at least blocks follow it in the longest fork in this case we say that the transaction has confirmations this gives the network time to come to an agreedupon the ordering of the blocks well also use this strategy for infocoin with the timeordering now understood lets return to think about what happens if a dishonest party tries to double spend suppose alice tries to double spend with bob and charlie one possible approach is for her to try to validate a block that includes both transactions assuming she has one percent of the computing power she will occasionally get lucky and validate the block by solving the proofofwork unfortunately for alice the double spending will be immediately spotted by other people in the infocoin network and rejected despite solving the proofofwork problem so thats not something we need to worry about a more serious problem occurs if she broadcasts two separate transactions in which she spends the same infocoin with bob and charlie respectively she might for example broadcast one transaction to a subset of the miners and the other transaction to another set of miners hoping to get both transactions validated in this way fortunately in this case as weve seen the network will eventually confirm one of these transactions but not both so for instance bobs transaction might ultimately be confirmed in which case bob can go ahead confidently meanwhile charlie will see that his transaction has not been confirmed and so will decline alices offer so this isnt a problem either in fact knowing that this will be the case there is little reason for alice to try this in the first place an important variant on double spending is if alice bob ie alice tries to spend a coin with charlie which she is also spending with herself ie giving back to herself this sounds like it ought to be easy to detect and deal with but of course its easy on a network to set up multiple identities associated with the same person or organization so this possibility needs to be considered in this case alices strategy is to wait until charlie accepts the infocoin which happens after the transaction has been confirmed times in the longest chain she will then attempt to fork the chain before the transaction with charlie adding a block which includes a transaction in which she pays herself unfortunately for alice its now very difficult for her to catch up with the longer fork other miners wont want to help her out since theyll be working on the longer fork and unless alice is able to solve the proofofwork at least as fast as everyone else in the network combined roughly that means controlling more than fifty percent of the computing power then she will just keep falling further and further behind of course she might get lucky we can for example imagine a scenario in which alice controls one percent of the computing power but happens to get lucky and finds six extra blocks in a row before the rest of the network has found any extra blocks in this case she might be able to get ahead and get control of the block chain but this particular event will occur with probability a more general analysis along these lines shows that alices probability of ever catching up is infinitesimal unless she is able to solve proofofwork puzzles at a rate approaching all other miners combined of course this is not a rigorous security analysis showing that alice cannot double spend its merely an informal plausibility argument the original paper introducing bitcoin did not in fact contain a rigorous security analysis only informal arguments along the lines ive presented here the security community is still analysing bitcoin and trying to understand possible vulnerabilities you can see some of this research listed here and i mention a few related problems in the problems for the author below at this point i think its fair to say that the jury is still out on how secure bitcoin is the proofofwork and mining ideas give rise to many questions how much reward is enough to persuade people to mine how does the change in supply of infocoins affect the infocoin economy will infocoin mining end up concentrated in the hands of a few or many if its just a few doesnt that endanger the security of the system presumably transaction fees will eventually equilibriate wont this introduce an unwanted source of friction and make small transactions less desirable these are all great questions but beyond the scope of this post i may come back to the questions in the context of bitcoin in a future post for now well stick to our focus on understanding how the bitcoin protocol works i dont understand why double spending cant be prevented in a simpler manner using twophase commit suppose alice tries to double spend an infocoin with both bob and charlie the idea is that bob and charlie would each broadcast their respective messages to the infocoin network along with a request should i accept this theyd then wait some period perhaps ten minutes to hear any naysayers who could prove that alice was trying to double spend if no such nays are heard and provided there are no signs of attempts to disrupt the network theyd then accept the transaction this protocol needs to be hardened against network attacks but it seems to me to be the core of a good alternate idea how well does this work what drawbacks and advantages does it have compared to the full bitcoin protocol early in the section i mentioned that there is a natural way of reducing the variance in time required to validate a block of transactions if that variance is reduced too much then it creates an interesting attack possibility suppose alice tries to fork the chain in such a way that a one fork starts with a block in which alice pays herself while the other fork starts with a block in which alice pays bob b both blocks are announced nearly simultaneously so roughly half the miners will attempt to mine each fork c alice uses her mining power to try to keep the forks of roughly equal length mining whichever fork is shorter this is ordinarily hard to pull off but becomes significantly easier if the standard deviation of the timetovalidation is much shorter than the network latency d after blocks have been mined on both forks alice throws her mining power into making it more likely that charless transaction is confirmed and e after confirmation of charless transaction she then throws her computational power into the other fork and attempts to regain the lead this balancing strategy will have only a small chance of success but while the probability is small it will certainly be much larger than in the standard protocol with high variance in the time to validate a block is there a way of avoiding this problem suppose bitcoin mining software always explored nonces starting with then if this is done by all or even just a substantial fraction of bitcoin miners then it creates a vulnerability namely its possible for someone to improve their odds of solving the proofofwork merely by starting with some other much larger nonce more generally it may be possible for attackers to exploit any systematic patterns in the way miners explore the space of nonces more generally still in the analysis of this section i have implicitly assumed a kind of symmetry between different miners in practice there will be asymmetries and a thorough security analysis will need to account for those asymmetries lets move away from infocoin and describe the actual bitcoin protocol there are a few new ideas here but with one exception discussed below theyre mostly obvious modifications to infocoin to use bitcoin in practice you first install a wallet program on your computer to give you a sense of what that means heres a screenshot of a wallet called multbit you can see the bitcoin balance on the left bitcoins or about dollars at the exchange rate on the day i took this screenshot and on the right two recent transactions which deposited those bitcoins suppose youre a merchant who has set up an online store and youve decided to allow people to pay using bitcoin what you do is tell your wallet program to generate a bitcoin address in response it will generate a public private key pair and then hash the public key to form your bitcoin address you then send your bitcoin address to the person who wants to buy from you you could do this in email or even put the address up publicly on a webpage this is safe since the address is merely a hash of your public key which can safely be known by the world anyway ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key the person who is going to pay you then generates a transaction lets take a look at the data from an actual transaction transferring bitcoins whats shown below is very nearly the raw data its changed in three ways the data has been deserialized line numbers have been added for ease of reference and ive abbreviated various hashes and public keys just putting in the first six hexadecimal digits of each when in reality they are much longer heres the data hashc ver vin_sz vout_sz lock_time size in prev_out hashae n scriptsig bd out value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash adbf op_equalverify op_checksig lets go through this line by line line contains the hash of the remainder of the transaction c expressed in hexadecimal this is used as an identifier for the transaction line tells us that this is a transaction in version of the bitcoin protocol lines and tell us that the transaction has one input and one output respectively ill talk below about transactions with more inputs and outputs and why thats useful line contains the value for lock_time which can be used to control when a transaction is finalized for most bitcoin transactions being carried out today the lock_time is set to which means the transaction is finalized immediately line tells us the size in bytes of the transaction note that its not the monetary amount being transferred that comes later lines through define the input to the transaction in particular lines through tell us that the input is to be taken from the output from an earlier transaction with the given hash which is expressed in hexadecimal as ae the n tells us its to be the first output from that transaction well see soon how multiple outputs and inputs from a transaction work so dont worry too much about this for now line contains the signature of the person sending the money followed by a space and then the corresponding public key bd again these are both in hexadecimal one thing to note about the input is that theres nothing explicitly specifying how many bitcoins from the previous transaction should be spent in this transaction in fact all the bitcoins from the n th output of the previous transaction are spent so for example if the n th output of the earlier transaction was bitcoins then bitcoins will be spent in this transaction this seems like an inconvenient restriction like trying to buy bread with a dollar note and not being able to break the note down the solution of course is to have a mechanism for providing change this can be done using transactions with multiple inputs and outputs which well discuss in the next section lines through define the output from the transaction in particular line tells us the value of the output bitcoins line is somewhat complicated the main thing to note is that the string adbf is the bitcoin address of the intended recipient of the funds written in hexadecimal in fact line is actually an expression in bitcoins scripting language im not going to describe that language in detail in this post the important thing to take away now is just that adbf is the bitcoin address you can now see by the way how bitcoin addresses the question i swept under the rug in the last section where do bitcoin serial numbers come from in fact the role of the serial number is played by transaction hashes in the transaction above for example the recipient is receiving bitcoins which come out of the first output of an earlier transaction with hash ae line if you go and look in the block chain for that transaction youd see that its output comes from a still earlier transaction and so on there are two clever things about using transaction hashes instead of serial numbers first in bitcoin theres not really any separate persistent coins at all just a long series of transactions in the block chain its a clever idea to realize that you dont need persistent coins and can just get by with a ledger of transactions second by operating in this way we remove the need for any central authority issuing serial numbers instead the serial numbers can be selfgenerated merely by hashing the transaction in fact its possible to keep following the chain of transactions further back in history ultimately this process must terminate this can happen in one of two ways the first possibilitty is that youll arrive at the very first bitcoin transaction contained in the socalled genesis block this is a special transaction having no inputs but a bitcoin output in other words this transaction establishes an initial money supply the genesis block is treated separately by bitcoin clients and i wont get into the details here although its along similar lines to the transaction above you can see the deserialized raw data here and read about the genesis block here the second possibility when you follow a chain of transactions back in time is that eventually youll arrive at a socalled coinbase transaction with the exception of the genesis block every block of transactions in the block chain starts with a special coinbase transaction this is the transaction rewarding the miner who validated that block of transactions it uses a similar but not identical format to the transaction above i wont go through the format in detail but if you want to see an example see here you can read a little more about coinbase transactions here something i havent been precise about above is what exactly is being signed by the digital signature in line the obvious thing to do is for the payer to sign the whole transaction apart from the transaction hash which of course must be generated later currently this is not what is done some pieces of the transaction are omitted this makes some pieces of the transaction malleable ie they can be changed later however this malleability does not include the amounts being paid out senders and recipients which cant be changed later i must admit i havent dug down into the details here i gather that this malleability is under discussion in the bitcoin developer community and there are efforts afoot to reduce or eliminate this malleability in the last section i described how a transaction with a single input and a single output works in practice its often extremely convenient to create bitcoin transactions with multiple inputs or multiple outputs ill talk below about why this can be useful but first lets take a look at the data from an actual transaction hash ver vin_sz vout_sz lock_time size in prev_out hashbeabc n scriptsig cd prev_out hashfdaeb n scriptsig e prev_out hashcb n scriptsig a out value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash ec op_equalverify op_checksig value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash de op_equalverify op_checksig lets go through the data line by line its very similar to the singleinputsingleoutput transaction so ill do this pretty quickly line contains the hash of the remainder of the transaction this is used as an identifier for the transaction line tells us that this is a transaction in version of the bitcoin protocol lines and tell us that the transaction has three inputs and two outputs respectively line contains the lock_time as in the singleinputsingleoutput case this is set to which means the transaction is finalized immediately line tells us the size of the transaction in bytes lines through define a list of the inputs to the transaction each corresponds to an output from a previous bitcoin transaction the first input is defined in lines through in particular lines through tell us that the input is to be taken from the n th output from the transaction with hash beabc line contains the signature followed by a space and then the public key of the person sending the bitcoins lines through define the second input with a similar format to lines through and lines through define the third input lines through define a list containing the two outputs from the transaction the first output is defined in lines and line tells us the value of the output bitcoins as before line is an expression in bitcoins scripting language the main thing to take away here is that the string ec is the bitcoin address of the intended recipient of the funds the second output is defined lines and with a similar format to the first output one apparent oddity in this description is that although each output has a bitcoin value associated to it the inputs do not of course the values of the respective inputs can be found by consulting the corresponding outputs in earlier transactions in a standard bitcoin transaction the sum of all the inputs in the transaction must be at least as much as the sum of all the outputs the only exception to this principle is the genesis block and in coinbase transactions both of which add to the overall bitcoin supply if the inputs sum up to more than the outputs then the excess is used as a transaction fee this is paid to whichever miner successfully validates the block which the current transaction is a part of thats all there is to multipleinputmultipleoutput transactions theyre a pretty simple variation on singleinputsingleoutputtransactions one nice application of multipleinputmultipleoutput transactions is the idea of change suppose for example that i want to send you bitcoins i can do so by spending money from a previous transaction in which i received bitcoins of course i dont want to send you the entire bitcoins the solution is to send you bitcoins and to send bitcoins to a bitcoin address which i own those bitcoins are the change of course it differs a little from the change you might receive in a store since change in this case is what you pay yourself but the broad idea is similar that completes a basic description of the main ideas behind bitcoin of course ive omitted many details this isnt a formal specification but i have described the main ideas behind the most common use cases for bitcoin while the rules of bitcoin are simple and easy to understand that doesnt mean that its easy to understand all the consequences of the rules there is vastly more that could be said about bitcoin and ill investigate some of these issues in future posts for now though ill wrap up by addressing a few loose ends how anonymous is bitcoin many people claim that bitcoin can be used anonymously this claim has led to the formation of marketplaces such as silk road and various successors which specialize in illegal goods however the claim that bitcoin is anonymous is a myth the block chain is public meaning that its possible for anyone to see every bitcoin transaction ever although bitcoin addresses arent immediately associated to realworld identities computer scientists have done a great deal of work figuring out how to deanonymize anonymous social networks the block chain is a marvellous target for these techniques i will be extremely surprised if the great majority of bitcoin users are not identified with relatively high confidence and ease in the near future the confidence wont be high enough to achieve convictions but will be high enough to identify likely targets furthermore identification will be retrospective meaning that someone who bought drugs on silk road in will still be identifiable on the basis of the block chain in say these deanonymization techniques are well known to computer scientists and one presumes therefore to the nsa i would not be at all surprised if the nsa and other agencies have already deanonymized many users it is in fact ironic that bitcoin is often touted as anonymous its not bitcoin is instead perhaps the most open and transparent financial instrument the world has ever seen can you get rich with bitcoin well maybe tim oreilly once said money is like gas in the car you need to pay attention or youll end up on the side of the road but a welllived life is not a tour of gas stations much of the interest in bitcoin comes from people whose life mission seems to be to find a really big gas station i must admit i find this perplexing what is i believe much more interesting and enjoyable is to think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a way of enabling new forms of collective behaviour thats intellectually fascinating offers marvellous creative possibilities is socially valuable and may just also put some money in the bank but if money in the bank is your primary concern then i believe that other strategies are much more likely to succeed details ive omitted although this post has described the main ideas behind bitcoin there are many details i havent mentioned one is a nice spacesaving trick used by the protocol based on a data structure known as a merkle tree its a detail but a splendid detail and worth checking out if fun data structures are your thing you can get an overview in the original bitcoin paper second ive said little about the bitcoin network questions like how the network deals with denial of service attacks how nodes join and leave the network and so on this is a fascinating topic but its also something of a mess of details and so ive omitted it you can read more about it at some of the links above bitcoin scripting in this post ive explained bitcoin as a form of digital online money but this is only a small part of a much bigger and more interesting story as weve seen every bitcoin transaction is associated to a script in the bitcoin programming language the scripts weve seen in this post describe simple transactions like alice gave bob bitcoins but the scripting language can also be used to express far more complicated transactions to put it another way bitcoin is programmable money in later posts i will explain the scripting system and how it is possible to use bitcoin scripting as a platform to experiment with all sorts of amazing financial instruments thanks for reading enjoy the essay you can tip me with bitcoin at address ukkktbnlaqdjqqvvaskrvymztz you may also enjoy the first chapter of my forthcoming book on neural networks and deep learning and may wish to follow me on twitter in the united states the question is money a form of speech is an important legal question because of the protection afforded speech under the us constitution in my legally uninformed opinion digital money may make this issue more complicated as well see the bitcoin protocol is really a way of standing up before the rest of the world or at least the rest of the bitcoin network and avowing im going to give suchandsuch a number of bitcoins to soandso a person in a way thats extremely difficult to repudiate at least naively it looks more like speech than exchanging copper coins say published december by michael nielsen categorized as uncategorized pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works enjoying the moment sumedh says december at pm thanks i was always too lazy to look up btc in detail your article cleared most of my questions i wanted to know one thing what if some smart hacker is able to find some vulnerability in the protocol and he uses that to generate new bitcoins for himself once that happens then whole confidence in bitcoins would be gone and it would lead to chaos is the above scenario possible bobby says december at pm your scenario is possible just like any other popular piece of open source software there are incentives for finding exploits but there are a lot of benevolent hackers examining the code to uncover and fix them michael nielsen says december at pm bobby good point yes that solves much of the problem neatly my broad point about asymmetries is still true however and is vividly demonstrated by the rise of large mining pools edit this is in response to your comment below i must have clicked on the wrong link when i replied achil says march at am each block starts with a coinbase transaction which should give bitcoins to the person who solved it since this transaction if different for any block each node working on the network has her bitcoin address as the recipient of that transaction all block in the network are different so we shouldnt at least not likely see two blocks with the same hashes gwern says december at pm that bug has actually happened before but satoshigavin fixed it before anyone else managed to exploit it there have been major live flaws in bitcoin that i know of one allowed you to generate billions of bitcoins and the other allowed you to spend anyones bitcoins neither was exploited before being patched and there dont seem to have been any big flaws found since rena says december at pm interesting how did those exploits work gwern says december at pm i dont know the technical details might want to look up the cves and the patches from the sound of them some validation check was omitted and so bad transactions were allowed bobby says december at pm i believe have the answer to your third question the raw block data that each miner is trying to solve contains a generation transaction that transaction is where their coins are sent if they solve that block because miners competing against each other want their coins to be sent to different addresses and those addresses are hashed together with their nonce it does not matter if everyone starts their nonce from zero the added randomness from differing generation transaction addresses prevents each miner from working in the same space as others michael says december at pm thanks bobby i had wondered about the same question as the author your explanation clears it up for me jc says december at pm moreover the nonces need not be enumerable if randomly picked from a large enough pool it is unlikely that the same nonce gets picked twice carles says december at pm very well written only one thing to add on another post when you launch multibit or bitcoinqt etc where does it connect a list of ips dns etc etc pål driveklepp says december at am bitcoin has methods for finding peers httpsenbitcoinitwikinetworkbootstrapping benoit says december at pm thank you for the great writeup you write ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key did i miss it does it have anything to do with quantum computing michael nielsen says december at pm oops actually i had an extended discussion of this question but deleted it just before i posted the reason i deleted it is that the discussion was inconclusive the separation seems to be a fairly arbitrary design decision there are some minor space and security advantages but not enough in my opinion to justify making the bitcoin address the hash rather than the public key mark friedenbach says december at pm theres a very serious security advantage the public key is not known until the moment it is spent that reduces the window during which the private key could be derived and used in a doublespend to about minutes this has significant ramifications for the safe transition to quantumproof cryptography if nothing else and spacewise were talking about saving hundreds of megabytes soon gigabytes of data from the utxo set thats not insignificant michael nielsen says december at pm mark youve described the two main points in the material i deleted to me both seem like relatively small points on the first point many people reuse addresses so in practice public keys are often widely known this problem could be reduced if bitcoin enforced a policy that addresses could only ever be used once but a thats not going to happen anytime soon b it introduces some other practical problems its useful to be able to publish an address widely and c it would still leave a window of time when the public key is widely known but the transaction is not yet confirmed on the second point i havent computed exactly but i suspect the space savings is less than ten percent of the total transaction size depending on the type of transaction thats significant but it also seems to me that other similar savings could easily have been had but are not so it does seem a bit arbitrary still as you point out its not insignificant actually it occurs to me that its pretty easy to modify the standard bitcoin transaction script so only public keys are used this might make a nice example for my post on bitcoin scripting david says january at am i have read that there is no known algorithm that would allow public keys to be derived from public addresses within a practicable timescale even with quantum computing however the same is not true for deriving private keys from public keys thus addresses that have not been used to spend have benefits in terms of being more qc proof i recall vitalik buterin writing on this topic boldra says december at am could the protocol save even more space by switching from json to yaml it looks like the protocol version is inside the json peter says december at am the json shown in this article is just a representation the blockchain actually lives in files of binary bytes concatenated together ie neither json nor yaml on each users computer benoit says december at pm about your first question what would be the incentive for nonminers to answer your question why would you trust the answers or lack thereof after all if i understand correctly when there is no transaction fee set aside the miners could very well choose to omit transactions from their blocks michael nielsen says december at pm on incentive such could be built into the protocol on trusting the answers if someone claims that they see evidence of double spending youd require them to present evidence in the form of a signed transaction the requirement of a signature makes this hard to forge by a malicious naysayer on your last point yes this is a very interesting question at present this all seems to be working okay but over the long run i suspect will limit the use of bitcoin for small transactions tom says december at am on the last point i could see the transaction fee being indirectly related to the time required to confirm a transfer if you want your transfer confirmed quicker then you have to pay on a related note what happens if blocks are validated out of time order mg says december at pm im curious what happens ifwhen the underlying crypto is either undermined or broken over the years weve seen flaws that reduce the bits entropy in many many systems how would the bitcoin protocol handle say a reduction of even bit of difficulty bit reduction as hard to attack also could someone with very large resources overwhelm the network with bad data eg if china wanted to use some super computers or a bot net to stop bitcoin from operating by adding all sorts of bad data to the block chains michael nielsen says december at pm denial of service type attacks are a real problem see eg httpsenbitcoinitwikiweaknessesdenial_of_service_dos_attacks on the first question the answer is i think thats really complicated and depends on the exact scenario of the break cabin says december at am android had a bug in their random number api that was successfully exploited losing a few bits of entropy wont matter but in this case they lost nearly all of them httpthegenesisblockcomsecurityvulnerabilityinallandroidbitcoinwallets mg says december at pm one additional question what happens to bitcoins that are lost ie what happens if the fbi refuses to sign over the bitcoins seized from silk road or wallets that had some coins but were lost due to hard drive failure bad backups or lost passphrases or maybe someone dies but the next of kin doesnt know the details the comparison is if i drop on the ground or my next of kin finds it under a mattress they can use it michael nielsen says december at pm lost bitcoins are just that gone from the money supply for good unless someone manages to either a recover the keypair or b breaks the underlying crypto mango cat says december at pm that brings up an interesting scenario on a long time scale there will have to be some allowance made for replacement of the lost coins or subdivision of the satoshi james h says december at pm with bitcoin losing the private key for good is more like accidentally dropping your coins out of an airplane over the pacific ocean the private key is crucial to recovering those coins hasitha n liyanage says december at pm looks like we both independently arrived at similar methods of explanation httpzenlkhowifinallyunderstoodbitcoin pingback understanding the bitcoin protocol minsheng 民生 amos says december at pm in the second paragraph of the bitcoin section seems it should be not michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed vidya says december at am thank you so much i had wanted an understandable primer on bitcoin since ages and this was a fabulous read boldra says december at am im surprised that bitcoins in a transaction are a decimal string it looks likely to cause floating point approximation errors have you read about coinjoin it follows on very nicely from what youve described here im looking forward to the next one michael nielsen says december at am theyre not actually a float as i mention in the article the minimal unit of bitcoin is the satoshi which is one one hundred millionth of a bitcoin so its really specifying an integer number of satoshis i havent checked what type is used in the source code id be interested to know michael nielsen says december at pm this page says that it is an integer in the original source httpsenbitcoinitwikiproper_money_handling_jsonrpc however it sounds as though there can occasionally be some floating point rounding issues with code used to do remote procedure calls over the bitcoin network uri says december at am just wanted to say thanks for a really great essay the explanation was really clear and totally fascinating pingback science technology roundup great wall of numbers pingback middayish links dump imagine art there aboutmiddayish links dump pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi geistwc jim says december at pm can quantum computers mine bitcoin faster does this boil down to how quickly a quantum computer can find a string that has a specified property for sha for which we have a quadratic speedup but probably no more i understand that commonly used digital signatures and publickey cryptosystems are broken by quantum computers so theres not much to be said about that michael nielsen says december at am i havent thought much about it with that said im pretty sure both your comments are right quadratic speedup for finding hash collisions and the asymmetric crypto stuff is broken asallai says december at pm this is an incredibly well written article and one that i needed so much thank you michael oli rhys says december at pm thanks for this while i understood the majority of it the coding element was very useful especially highlighting where the script goes in conjunction with the transaction while a lot of people know abot bitcoin there is such a shortage of good quality technical info thanks again andrew jaeger says december at pm great writeup about how bitcoin functions on a technical level but i had a question about it as its use as a currency why is bitcoin built to be inherently deflationary this seems to be the goto argument against why it will ever gain widespread adoption as a currency why does the reward for mining bitcoin halve every blocks could there be a point in the future where this is reversed michael nielsen says december at am good questions and i dont know i certainly suspect as do you that these may ultimately turn out to be design flaws assaf says december at am bitcoin is not deflationary it is inflationary with a known and decreasing rate up until around at which point it will stop being inflationary the only deflation in bitcoin may happen through coin loss the same by the way is true for fiat the difference is that fiat can be arbitrarily inflated and with bitcoin it is not arbitrary as far as why inflation is predetermined this is so bitcoin is a better store of value which is one of the defining properties of a good money why is it inflationary at all as in why not start with a predetermined amount of bitcoins that never change the is part of bitcoins decentralized design bitcoin designers wanted a way to spread bitcoins around without starting with a central authority that has them all and gives them out like say ripple the bitcoin generating part of mining does exactly that btw i am yet to see a good argument about why having a monetary system that is a good store of value and does not get diluted over time with inflation is bad krg says december at pm inflationarydeflationary are properties of currency production relatively to the supply of real goods bitcoin is only not deflationary if you assume that real wealth production will gradually slow and eventually stabilize around at the same pace as the drop in bitcoin production and thats not even accounting for the effective tax pressure of the transaction fee needing to increase to attract the necessary computational power as the system of directly paying for that service phases out the more that needs to be paid out in each transaction to cover the fees the lower prices and actual payments will have to fall to make room for that overhead lower revenue translates to lower ability to afford a given price level and so on bitcoin has already seen hyperdeflation that rewarded early speculators but the defined limitations in supply are far more likely to encourage more speculation over it as a commodity than less making its reliability for any predictable future value never mind usefulness as an accounting measure to reliably store value rather questionable what actually needs to be demonstrated is that there is any value in allowing any static nonproductive account to maintain its nominal value as opposed to using the inherent decline in the value of such accounts provide the baseline motivation to use more productive investments to store anything beyond cash sufficient to meet immediate needs for liquidity theres no justification to use the monetary system to store value because value is a property or real assets not the money that serves to account for them trying to store value in money rather than in future production potential is the ultimate perverse incentive rewarding fraud and financial manipulation far out of proportion to development of real assets mellyra says december at pm assaf is talking about inflationdeflation of the money supply you are talking about price inflationdeflation both usages are common in economics jonathan goldberg says december at pm there are excellent reasons for wanting to store value one obvious one is the desire to save for retirement back in paul samuelson wrote a classic paper on the utility of money as a store of value an exact consumptionloan model of interest with or without the social contrivance of money jpe v dec dave says january at pm actually bitcoin is inherently deflationary if you believe that the size of the bitcoin economy will grow faster than the money supply although not quite intuitive it does make sense upon reflection that the money supply reflects the value of the economy it represents if the money supply is growing faster than the underlying economy then you get inflation if the money supply is growing slower than the economy you get deflation i think all but a few of us expect the bitcoin economy to grow faster than the supply of bitcoins hence we have a deflationary currency the wisdom of that choice is another mater of course one could imagine many different scenarios for the amount and timing and conditions of new currency entering the system if bitcoin doesnt takeovertheworld then my bet is that these will be significant dimensions of experimentation among variants wanton says december at pm im confused about the block chain does everyone have their own version of it or do they sync to a master does every block chain get updated when validation is completed does this mean every person has a record of everyone elses transactions for ever wont this file get really really big michael nielsen says december at am in practice there are thin clients which dont keep a full copy of the block chain but the way the protocol is designed at present there is a sizeable number of people keeping a full copy of the block chain this is currently quite a manageable size about gig if bitcoin grows rapidly enough this may eventually become a problem theres a nice discussion of this and related scalability issues here httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability the conclusion there which seems to me believable is that there are many options for scaling bitcoin at least up to the level at which credit cards are used today and perhaps further sunny says december at pm just about the total amount of bitcoins if i understand well new bitcoins are generated each time a transaction is processed it means the more exchange we have the more bitcoins in the market there is so the only way to raise the number of bitcoins is to spend some energy validating transaction thats a little bit wired for me how were created the first bitcoins is there another way of creating bitcoins that checking transactions and thanks a lot for this post because its really difficult to get a clear picture of what is it regards marco says february at pm not per transaction but per block of transactions exchanges are a bad example the transactions within the exchange happen outside the network only if you deposit or withdrawal btc tofrom an exchange it goes over the network and therefore show up in the block chain there are so many trades going on within an exchange it happens internally and since trades need to happen fast the network is not suited for that yes google for the genesis block thats how it got started no daniel r grayson says december at pm very nice comments you use the concept of mining before defining it change possibility vulnerabilities to possible vulnerabilities fix spending spending money michael nielsen says december at am thanks typos fixed greg says december at pm excellent article i found two typos which you might want to zap bob doesnt just go ahead and accept the transaction instead he broadcast alices message to the entire network change broadcast to broadcasts will infocoin mining end up in concentrated in the hands of a few or many remove first in michael nielsen says december at am thanks typos fixed pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi mark solock blog mango cat says december at pm thanks for the great bitcoin writeup i have gleaned most of what you said in bits and pieces from articles and message boards its nice to see it all described so clearly in one place what i think is more interesting than the cryptography aspect is the socialmotivational aspect of bitcoin and why it seems to be succeeding first big mover and branding seem to be inplay and the anonymous cash myth also was a big factor but beyond that i think the carrot of get paid for solving hard problems often using other peoples computing resources has drawn in many participants who have helped grow the network by promoting their own self interests i balk every time i hear the bit about every transaction for all users for all time is encoded into the block chain especially when combined with the chain is developed by solving hard problems scaling this system to support a billion users transacting multiple times per day seems unlikely your explanation does help to show how the problems dont get much harder as transactions scale up the blocks themselves get larger but the hash problem doesnt get significantly harder as block size grows unless you start talking about transacting the worlds monetary business in such a system then those blocks would get uncomfortably large in a very short time period and the forking problem would be much more complex than choosing between two or three chains to follow i also somewhat disapprove of the concept of encouraging people to mine digital space to earn currency since that creates an artificial demand for energy which could grow into a significant waste of real world resources as such a system scales up i have been playing trust network thought games since the s id like to see a peertopeer digital currency system that is based in the concept of trustworthy digital identities instead of solving hash problems to get paid you could still get paid by validating transactions but it wouldnt have that appeal of solve more problems get more paid plus a system based on trust would tend to concentrate trust in central authorities that would be quickly perceived as hopeless to surpass in trustworthiness semidefeating the incentive to participate as a trusted member of the network unless some kind of carrot to the underdogs was included which would be purely socialmotivational instead of a technically required component anyway all very interesting to watch as usual i got in late and out early with bitcoin bought around sold around seemed like an awesome profit margin at the time that aspect of bitcoin is a lot like any other speculative investment and is certainly fueling interest at this stage michael nielsen says december at am on scalability check out httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability theres a lot of useful information there like you though i wonder about the longrun economics and impact of mining michael newman says december at pm thanks for writing this great explanation of bitcoin i noticed in the first bitcoin transaction example you mention bitcoins but the example really deals with bitcoins where bitcoins goes to one person and there is a bitcoin transaction fee in other words did you mean instead of also is there a need to show value as an image michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed joseph reagle says december at pm typo trying to understand possibility vulnerabilities possible michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed jack l says december at pm thanks for the excellent writeup i have a question about one item hopefully you can explain it it appears the money you send someone is merely chunks of one or more previous transactions lets say i receive bitcoin at myaddress_ and i receive bitcoin at myaddress_ i now want to send you bitcoins from myaddress_ those previous transactions are the inputs for my transaction to you how does the transaction message for the bitcoin transaction prove that i was the recipient of those previous transactions when the addresses are all different is the hash for each input in the new transaction something that can only be generated by whoever was the recipient in the original transactions myaddress_ or myaddress_ if the answer is yes then it seems like unique addresses can be easily linked in which case i dont see any anonymity advantage of using new addresses for each transaction sorry if im missing something obvious here michael nielsen says december at am the proof is in the digital signature that signature is generated using a public key which must match when hashed the address from the output to the earlier transaction that proves that the bitcoins are the payers to spend ajay says december at pm but if i understand correctly the need for every transaction to be publicly verified means that you are tied to all your transactions you cant maintain a double life if i were a criminal i might find it very desirable to have two personas stringer who sells drugs and russell bell wellknown property developer and pillar of the community and use the cash that stringer collects to bankroll russells legitimate businesses but theres no way to do that with bitcoin i cant transfer stringers bitcoins to russell without everyone else in the world knowing about it anyone with a copy of the block chain can notice that the flow of money goes from various drug users to stringer to russell jim lyon says december at pm if you really want to enable money laundering first create a bank a bank would let any customer use bitcoin transactions to deposit andor withdraw value and the bank would keep its own record of individual customers accounts when withdrawing bitcoins you would get bitcoins that were the banks to give but that were unrelated to the ones you originally deposited such a bank would have more uses than just money laundering it could pay interest make loans charging interest convert bitcoins tofrom more traditional currencies etc space says december at pm extending from j lyons answer say you need to send from one or more of your bitcoin addresses to a badguy but wish to anonymize this transaction you will use a trusted middleman that does several transactions each day some with goodguys and some with badguys in one simple scenario the middleman sets up a recievables address xxx into which all the depositors send their bitcoins ie the depositors all use xxx address as their output the middleman then transfers out the necessary amounts to intermediate addresses yyy yyym that he has set up specifically for this transaction period after this is done the middleman provides the yyy addresses one to each reciever because all the incoming money has gone into the xxx address there is no way to separate out subsequently which money went to which reciever if all the yyyy addresses belong to bad guys then you would be guilty by association many bitcoin services perform such mixing by default based on what i have read the legal ramifications for the mixing service provider are unclear to me ajay says december at am got it thanks but such a bank would have to keep its own records both as a practical necessity and as a legal requirement and those could be obtained by the authorities whereas cash can be laundered tracelessly through a cash business like a casino or restaurant which can perfectly innocently be expected to have lots of cash coming in and no way of knowing where it comes from avee says december at pm interestingly this is exactly what was done with silk road it basically was a bitcoin bank moving bitcoins around in such a way the buyer and seller could not be connected theres a paper which has some details about that httpicdnturnercommoneyimagessilkroadpaperpdf con kolivas says december at pm nonce starting at zero is not a vulnerability shares are stochastically distributed throughout the nonce range and it makes no difference where you start the nonce is simply bits out of the whole bit coinbase that you are hashing and there is no way to design a target solution to be distributed anywhere within the nonce range of those bits if you start at a higher nonce value you simply will have less possible chances at finding a solution before youll need to getcreate a new coinbase to hash alex f says december at pm i think maybe youre misinterpreting his concern the danger isnt that someone can solve blocks strictly faster by starting at a different nonce because as you say the correct nonce could be anywhere in the range so every guess has the same chance of being correct instead the danger is that someone could solve blocks faster than everyone else if they start at a higher nonce and everyone else starts at specifically assuming on average everyone can calculate guesses at the same rate then any transaction whose correct nonce is higher than x will always be solved first by someone who started at y if yx of course this creates an obvious incentive for all participants to try to guess nonces in a different order than everyone else so it seems reasonable that most client software would use a random sequence of nonce guesses rather than guessing sequentially from but still if one were to find a vulnerability in the random number generator of a popular client then it might be possible to design a competing client which would in practice almost always find the correct nonce before the targeted client by virtue of guessing the same sequence a few steps ahead that would allow the attacker to successfully validate a share of blocks greater than their actual portion of the collective computational power at the cost of everyone using the vulnerable client and finding the nonce less often than they should on average gergely imreh says december at pm i think theres also a time field in the part that is hashed which is also updated every few seconds thus in practice its not the case that everyone has the same message and they just run the nonces but everyone has a different message regardless of the nonces see httpsenbitcoinitwikiblock_hashing_algorithm michael nielsen says december at am alex has explained my concern well however as a number of people have pointed out including gergely in fact there are in any case small differences in the blocks being hashed by different miners and thats sufficient to make this a nonissue rubberman says december at pm a most excellent and well written article i look forward to more thanks pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works adafruit industries blog bram stolk says december at am as people make transactions the public ledger grows will it not grow to an unmanageable size at some time julian says december at am i have a couple questions possibly a subject for a future article if the block chain forks do the miners on both sides of the fork keep their rewards if so doesnt it allow someone to continue executing the proof of work even when it is known that someone else has solved the proof of work i am puzzled by transactions in blocks is it not possible for two miners to be working on different blocks which contain mostly although not all the same transactions then the first one to solve the proof of work will have validated some of the transactions in the second miners block does the second miner restart by taking his unverified transactions and putting them in a new block michael nielsen says december at am on yes if youre mining and someone else validates some of the transactions you are working on then you remove them from your queue but continue working with the unvalidated transactions on its true that in different forks different miners will have been rewarded however over time only one of the forks will become the accepted consensus for confirmed transactions and so only the miners from one fork will be able to redeem their transactions rob says december at am fascinating read thank you one thing im having difficulty with is block chain integrity what will happen when an owner loses his wallet restores a backup from a few weeks back he may have spent some coins and he may have received some those transactions are no longer in his block chain how would the block chain get back in sync on your questiontoyourself about using two phase commit i think the major issue would be vulnerability to denialofservice attack a malicious user could set up a swarm of identities to act as naysayers and therewith deny some or all others from performing transactions benjamin marty says december at am in my experience using the bitcoin client you are not allowed to do anything on the bitcoin network until your block chain is in sync with the latest transactions it somehow recognizes how far behind your block chain is and starts downloading blocks and tells you how old your block chain is and how much left you have to update as it downloads more btw i uninstalled the bitcoin client because over the year span that i had it installed the block chain went from about gb to about gb and the novelty of having my own copy of the block chain wore off in comparison to its cost it would be nice if there were some kind of reset block that could be generated that flattened the tree into a single block enumerating the value stored at each address michael nielsen says december at am on the naysayer ddos attack on twophase commit if someone claims that they see evidence of double spending youd require them to present evidence in the form of a signed transaction the requirement of a signature makes this hard to forge by a malicious naysayer pingback the bitcoin protocol iamronen pingback links naked capitalism uez says december at am here is a very entertaining rational explanation httpwwwbringhurstorghowdoesbitcoincryptoworkhtml pingback bitcoin for dummies author walks users through how bitcoin actually works my blog benjamin marty says december at pm one thing i still dont fully understand is how the bitcoin reward size is decided and awarded who enforces the rules that bitcoins are awarded for validating a block and a few years hence itll be bitcoins if we were to decide that the rewards should be different remaining at indefinitely for example what exactly would have to change is it the bitcoin mining clients that are hardwired to only validate transactions that award coins to other miners when they validate their blocks and the date of the validated block indicates that the award should be btc michael nielsen says december at am its hardcoded based on the number of blocks in the blockchain every blocks the rate halves no need to keep track of the date simply count blocks michal says december at pm hi and cannot miners just continue to validating the the transaction with adding bitcoins as the chain is just validated list of transactions how there can be any cap on transactions what does hardcoded mean practically jozef says february at pm you only own that much of bitcoins as others agree you own so hardcoded here means it is the original protocol suggested and supposed to be honored by all the users theres no use for miner to continue giving himself btc when its already time for lowering the reward to because this reward would not be considered valid by others who respect the original protocol anton d says may at pm would it be in principle possible for all miners to agree on not lowering the reward at all for example to continue to reward per block for all eternity nick p says december at pm i hadnt had time to thoroughly delve into the protocol and your excellent writeup is the exact piece by piece whatwhy i needed the whys are extremely important to people who might want to build on top of the protocol as it helps them understand what they should or shouldnt modify pebird says december at pm i was thinking about how the blockchain is managed as more transactions are processed thanks for the link httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability interesting one of the potential solutions discussed is the use of dedicated servers instead of lightweight clients to increase transaction rates reduce latency handle increasing blockchain size via techniques such as pruning the chain etc what this implies of course is an evolution into banks a group of entities with sufficient resources and staying power to dedicate specialized btc infrastructure for transaction handling in a way bitcoin is replicating a history of money evolution in an accelerated manner i wonder what will take place in the protocol to allow the peertopeer nature to continue while scaling the project to allow the transaction capacity necessary for a true currency michael nielsen says

it all means the devil and the delight are in the details stuart quimby terikan says december at pm bitcoin has fascinated me recently i admit to not being able to fully wrap my head around it but i took what i could and wrote a little here httpmimictradingcomviewtopicphpft maybe you can help me out with one part of this i dont quite get the signature how does the block chain know that the address sending the coins is correct the sender sends their sig to go with it i assume paired up with the hash of the address allows the various nodes to validate right but if you are sending your sig out then cant any node have access to that private info they would need to in order to validate so can a sig only be used once and if so how is it generated and what prevents it from being faked cryptograffre says december at am httpsenwikipediaorgwikidigital_signature public key cryptography is a remarkable and beautiful thing each client using bitcoin has keypairs one key in each pair is public the other private the nature of asymmetric cryptographic digital signatures is that i can sign any piece of data using my private key and anyone else with only my public key can verify that the person who signed that data holds the private key theres some fascinating mathematics involved exploiting a simple numerical relationship between the public and private keys richnormand says december at pm very nicely done writeup makes me wonder about the news at various times about a major theft of bitcoins mostly in exchanges in order to benefit they would have to be converted or be reintroduced later on some of these were for large amounts and not really easy to hide unless you just sit on them michael nielsen says december at am ive wondered the same thing some observations if you copy someones private key and then erase their copy there is no way for them to prove that it was ever truly their key and if two people both have a copy of the private key how do you determine who truly owns it the situation is complicated further by the possibility of laundering if you quickly spend some stolen bitcoins on then it becomes very different to later recover those bitcoins

modified version of the software to choose not to publish a transaction in the blockchain i mean like a small group of powerful miners controlling the entire network mark says december at pm if you control half or more of the total mining power in the network you can keep a transaction out of the blockchain by solving blocks faster on average than the miners who are trying to include that transaction if you control less than half you can delay the transaction but sooner or later the rest of the miners will get ahead of you and your version of the blockchain will lose out pingback how

problem bitcoins arent actually backed by anything other than server time there was a time in this country when you can go to the bank and trade in your dollar bill for an oz of gold you cant do that anymore bc today dollars are back by debt not gold but bitcoins are backed by server time that almost makes less sense than backed by debt thomas mahoney says december at pm i think youre confusing an investment with a medium of exchange an investment should be backed up by something in the sense that it should give the holder a claim future cash flows or other real assets but a medium of exchange is just that something used to facilitate trade an accounting device it should have scarcity value and be resistant to counterfeiting fiat currencies have scarcity value to the extent that they are usually printed in finite amounts gold is generally scarce and bitcoin is scarce as well gold has been used as a medium of exchange for centuries what is it backed up by nothing its just scarce and therefore suitable as a medium of exchange miksa says december at pm bbc had an interesting article called why do we value gold few days ago httpwwwbbccouknewsmagazine marco says february at pm if

thought you might like to know that at least for some of us rss aint sing michael nielsen says december at pm i checked in my rss reader the old reader and both blogs seem to come through fine odd marc says december at am it just now showed up in my feed december pacific time where its been all this time i may never know just thought id let you know joseph says december at pm am i to understand that it takes about minutes to pay somebody through the bitcoin network i reached this conclusion based on the minute average block confirmation and the requirement of it being back in the chain before it is considered confirmed thanks joseph michael nielsen says december at pm full confirmation requires about minutes many people are willing to accept payment on more trust though say after just a single confirmation mins yes this is a significant disadvantage of the protocol in its present architecture marco says february at pm transactions are instant confirmations are not a confirmation takes minutes if you want full confirmation then yes on average it takes an hour confirmations for ecommerce this will probably work in most cases for retail this can be an issue however there are a few points if you try to double spend it doesnt mean you will succeed it is not easy to double spend in front of the cash register unless you have build some app and are all prepared the merchant i think bitpay is doing this can listen on the network to see if there was a double spend attempt those are easily detected dont forget that a credit card payment can be charged back months

all i got is the hash of the public key dont i need the full public key for that instead of only the hash what am i missing guys michael nielsen says december at pm the transaction contains the

of places in the article tom hatcher says december at pm thank you best explanation ive seen so far i still dont understand it completely but its slowly becoming clearer one question though i hear that its open source and we can look at the source code id like to do that its written in c where can i find the code and look at it thank you tom hatcher says december at am i answer my own question its at githubcom fee fi fo fum says december at pm i would love to see you discuss tumblers and the effectiveness and possibility of anonymizing your bitcoins pingback friday links meta rabbit pingback bitcoin pingback virtual mining bitcoin news bitcoin open source money whose time has come cb says december at am in your anonymous section you speak of debunking a fairly huge myth without really backing it up you just state the equivalent of actually its not anonymous without going into detail i dont believe that to be true unless you are implying that various ways of using the internet anonymously are breakable for instance if tor is compromised versus if it is not or if other methods of obscuring traffic surrounding use of bitcoins are insufficient your assertion that bitcoin is open and transparent has nothing to do with its ability to use it anonymously and the claim that it wouldnt be able to achieve convictions but will narrow the pool of suspects down sound closer to a statement of successful anonymity rather than unsuccessful michael nielsen says december at am you just state the equivalent of actually its not anonymous without going into detail its certainly not meant to be a proof i do however go a great deal further than just saying its not anonymous i reference a large and growing body of academic literature that takes supposedly anonymous data sets and then deanonymizes them i believe techniques similar to those used in those papers will be very useful for attacking bitcoin there are complications in bitcoin notably that some people though far from all routinely use new addresses for each transaction that makes an interesting challenge and i think is different than in earlier work on deanonymization ill be most curious to hear what the deanonymizers have to say after making a sustained attempt at bitcoin magnus sorenson says december at pm linking bitcoin addresses to a real identity requires that a real identity is somehow associated with an address in the first place if i buy bitcoin on the street with cash without revealing any personal information using a public network and a device with a mac address that cant be linked to me then i can spend that bitcoin with absolute anonymity unless i reveal personal info to whoever i send that bitcoin to in the case of silk road the guy who sends me the drugs would need my mailing address but that can be fudged as well if he does not store my mailing address nothing gets linked to me if the drugs arrive safely throw in a mixing service and on that transaction not even the nsa can id me from the blockchain now if i do the same thing many times it may be possible to id me using other vectors but explain how anyone could id me using the blockchain if i buy the bitcoin with cash on the street and spend it leaving no permanent record i assert that bitcoin can be anonymous forever if you do it right merkletree says december at am the system is anonymous but traceable if you receive bit coins from somewhere and never spend them thats fine but it becomes possible to track addresses back to wallets via change addresses that are created during man transactions there are several other methods as well i suggest you look up bitiodine httpowlysyzv you will find that many addresses can be identified with a bit of heuristic effort to remain anonymous you have to take pretty extreme measures this includes the use of tumblers and foggers but you cannot guarantee they will work this leads to the interesting point that if you steal bit coins they are dangerous to spend adam back says december at am you mention using multiple subpuzzles to reduce variance this is a bad idea as it introduces progress because bitcoin is a firstpastthepost race progress gives an unfair advantage to more powerful miners x reward for x power michael nielsen says december at am youre presuming a particular design in which people solve a set of puzzles privately there is no necessity to make that presumption this is why i make the first part of the statement with some careful design it is possible to considerably reduce the variance in the time to validate a block of transactions i havent worked out the best possible design however i have found a design whose distribution is quite a bit more sharply peaked around minutes than the current puzzle unfortunately the details are more complex than i want to write out right now i may come back to it in a future post adam back says december at am also you talk about risk of nonce reuse this wont happen because people mine for their own reward address so even if the nonce is reused the work proof wont be further in the case of pool mining the pools hand out work specifically to avoid nonce reuse which is somewhat insecure as others could guess the work range of other users and race them to produce it and finally the secure way is pooled miners use getblocktemplate and use a large random counter start extranonce if extranonce is large enough and random the probability of nonce collision is pratically you can read about this in the hashcash paper httphashcashorgpapershashcashpdf or httpsenbitcoinitwikihashcash for decentralization miners should also choose their own blocks by running as a full node and filling in the details into the coinbase provided by getblocktemplate adam back says december at am twophase commit if you are willing to wait minutes bitcoin already does that i presume the form it would take is the proof of double spend would be one of the double spends there have been proposals to forward doublespends with a doublespent marker currently the first only is received maybe just an api to ask if there are any transactions conflicting with a given transaction a user could ask a few random nodes to gain confidence you also have to bear in mind preserving the confirmation spend functionality many people rely on that for low value point of sale transactions srm says december at pm ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key i dont think you ever come back to this topic michael nielsen says december at pm see the discussion above in reply to benoit mason pingback bitcoins cash and gold gusbook johnt says december at pm thank you for the primer you might consider removing the footnote imo bitcoin cannot be successfully defended as free speech free speech is not a full blown unlimited right as yelling fire in a crowded theater reminds us but article i section subparagraph

think that the parametres of the puzzle differs for every single miner everyones desired block contains a unique transaction that no other miner has a transation of giving a reward to himself so there is no point in trying to trick others parametres of their puzzles are different its ok for everyone to just try etc michael nielsen says december at pm already addressed in comments above joshua holden says december at pm so if ive got this right one proofofwork computation takes about minutes and you you currently get bitcoins for doing it and each bitcoin is currently worth about usd right if so this only makes sense if most proofofwork computations dont get finished andor dont get rewarded is that usually because someone else got there first do you know about what fraction of proofofwork computations get rewarded this was really useful thanks steffen says march at pm joshua yes its a race whoever finds the hash that is smaller than the currently defined difficulty they

the article very interesting but i dont see any mechanism for recombining fractional bitcoins im puzzled by what seems to be an everincreasing fragmentation it seems that over time you would accumulate a large number of coins of varying fractional values and to make a payment you would have to lump together a collection of fractional coins to equal or exceed the transaction required then typically end up with paying yourself your change this oneway process of cutting off pieces of a bitcoin would continue steadily a holding of one bitcoin would end up being constituted of maybe hundred or thousands of differentlysized fractions if thats the case that will make transactions increasingly messy you may have to consolidate a large number of inputs for one payment in turn that will lead to the block chain file growing faster and faster did i miss something michael nielsen says december at am this is not a problem yes some transactions will fragment bitcoins but other transactions undo fragmentation for example a input output transaction will reduce fragmentation this sounds a little complex for the user but in practice good client software will make this invisible you simply say i want to send suchandsuch bitcoins to soandso address and all the details of combining transactions will be taken care of in this sense its actually easier than cash where we deal with

price pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works and what that means for us helping public markets grow edward says december at pm very informative article thank you i was wondering with regard to transaction fees i assume it is up to the first miner to successfully validate a block to determine if your offered fee is large enough to be included in the next iteration of the block chain additionally i assume you have to determine what fee youre willing to pay well in advance of the next chain being verified if this is the case and we fastforward to wont all miners assuming the computing power isnt concentrated be incentivized to take any transaction fee no matter how small for instance if i have of the computing power i should on average validate a block once every years hopefully the maths right it would be infrequent in any regard and considering assuming there would be no marginal cost to include a transaction or transactions offering me only equivalent in transaction fees i cant think of why i wouldnt validate that transaction as such even if there were a few big players who controlled say of the computing power on average one in blocks would be validated by a smaller player who wouldnt care about pricing since people already wait nearly an hour to finalize a transaction likely theyd be willing to wait an extra minutes and as such the big miners would likely just lower their fee thresholds pretty substantially wouldnt this create an odd prisoners dilemmaesque situation maybe im missing something but it strikes me that this would end with low fees forcing people out of business until computing power concentrated amongst an oligomonopoly of miners who could exercise sufficient pricing control which as you pointed out would probably create integrity concerns i believe ive previously read somewhere that there was a price threshold required to incentivize mining at different levels of complexity for instance if bitcoin were tomorrow would miners continue to mine or would the marginal cost of running the equipment outweigh the reward ignoring fees if thats the case and a scenario like that occurs does bitcoin grind to a halt or will some miners shut down or start running less expensive equipment as they did when bitcoin was in that price range i guess this sort of boils down to whether the use of high cost computing equipment is a function of competition and price or problem complexity both are hypothetical but i was curious to know if you or anyone had considered these questions thanks again for the article

anoncoin phenixcoin primecoin etc i take it that the protocol is the same among the clients though hash algorithms proofs of concept and the like may differ from what i understand if i use xpms and want to buy something from a vendor who accepts btcs i have to go through some broker or exchange facility to complete the transaction if thats correct and considering the us in a vacuum isnt it like were all carrying around a different brand of currency usds yen pounds etc and have to exchange them almost every time we want to buy something its easy with credit cards but i dont see a similar approach with bitcoins thanks david says january at am i dont understand why double spending cant be prevented in a simpler manner using twophase commit suppose alice tries to double spend an infocoin with both bob and charlie the idea is that bob and charlie would each broadcast their respective messages to the infocoin network along with a request should i accept this theyd then wait some period perhaps ten minutes to hear any naysayers who could prove that alice was trying to double spend if no such nays are heard and provided there are no signs of attempts to disrupt the network theyd then accept the transaction this protocol needs to be hardened against network attacks but it seems to me to be the core of a good alternate idea how well does this work what drawbacks and advantages does it have compared to the full bitcoin protocol i think something along these lines is planned on top of all that is a long list of new features and improvements id like to see get into a release the highest priorities on my wish list are first doublespend relay and detection detecting attempted doublespends as soon as possible is great for lowvalue inperson transactions and we should do more to support that use case httpsbitcoinfoundationorgblogp david says january at am great article i will use it as a selfstudy tutorial in your next instalment could you give a broad description of where the protocol is actually to be found is it a particular piece of software how can it be changed who can change it and indeed to what extent is it capable of being changed these are important questions

pingback de week in woorden bits of freedom dave says january at pm hi great article thanks for putting it together i am still having one big problem and i feel like i must be missing something obvious you wrote suppose alice tries to double spend with bob and charlie one possible approach is for her to try to validate a block that includes both transactions assuming she has one percent of the computing power she will occasionally get lucky and validate the block by solving the proofofwork unfortunately for alice the double spending will be immediately spotted by other people in the infocoin network and rejected despite solving the proofofwork problem so thats not something we need to worry about who is going to be looking to reject it and what does that even mean if a malicious party alice manages to complete a block that contains transactions that are not in fact valid then what do other miners check them before building on top of her faulty block and if not then what does it mean for others to spot them this has been bugging me for days your thoughts would be greatly appreciated michael nielsen says january at pm anyone with a copy of the block chain is not going to accept an additional block which has an obvious attempt to double spend in it dave says january at pm thanks so that means that miners examine each block for conflicts before they choose to build on it and if thats true how is the overhead of that inspection built into the incentive structure will their block if they solve it become invalidated if down the line someone points out that they built on a block with a double spend that would make sense but it isnt a step that i have seen described michael nielsen says january at pm checking for a double spend within a block is computationally negligible pingback bitcoins the hard way using the raw bitcoin protocol bitcoin daniel park says february at am thats a long detailed process of bitcoin above which was a great read i dont quite understand near the end but i definitely get the gist of it i dont perfectly understand the relationship between transactions and blocks is this only required when ppl try to cheat the system if so the money earned by miner essentially is imaginary and something that only exists within trust that bitcoin is going to continue to work i guess there are two cases as miners get bitcoins the value of bitcoin comparison to other currencies drop this is probably the case or as miners get bitcoins if it comes to a point where everyone wants to convert their bitcoins to real currency its not going to equal each other bitcoins conversion via bitcoin exchange rate not enough real money also why assume every blocks is occurs every years is this an assumption based on bitcoin flow so far wouldnt every blocks occur more often if there is more flow steffen says march at pm if everybody would like to exit bitcoin at the same time the price would collapse the current speculation is though that the opposite is true many people try to buy bitcoins for the fiat money how many please see here httpfiatleakcom with regards to why blocks are created in roughly four years the network difficulty is set so that only six blocks per hour can be created roughly every minutes a new block enters the blockchain lets do the math years days hours hours blocks pingback on bitcoin emergent chaos pingback bitcoin critical massexplosion wheres it going turing machine pingback bitcoin beyond money soshitech social media technology soshitechcom pingback bitcoin reading for developers coffee spoons of code jozef says february at pm fairly good explanation although some important things missing one mistake though so if we want the output hash value to begin with zeroes say then david will need on average to try approx different values for x before he finds a suitable nonce i think it should be on average at worst it is michael nielsen says february at pm no the average number of trials is if we repeatedly sample from a bernoulli random variable with probability p of a success then the expected number of trials to success is sum_ninfty n p pn which is easily shown to be p the probability p in the proofofwork is so the expected number of trials to success is what important things are missing from the explanation pingback the homebrew litecoin mining project record important events of digital currencies pingback complete dogecoin guide introduction into mining everything doge lex says february at am i have alot of questions about bitcoin and ive done alot of searching this explanation has to be the one that has got me the closest to the answers ive been looking for unfortunately im still falling short of understanding alot of the basic i do want to ask question here which seems to be the most important question for me in computer science terms what is a bitcoin there were points in this article where it seemed close to specifying this although i may have actually missed the answer so what is a bitcoin is it a unique value if i have bitcoins what is it that i really have unique values or is it simply a value that was said to be giving to me and simply assigned a value sort of like the th entry in a ledger in the genesis block it was said bitcoin was givin to whom ever bitcoin was given to bill and we will call that overall im still searching for clarity on the fundamental idea of a bitcoin from a computer science view pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi arca david lee says february at pm michael we are organising world bitcoin conference on march in malaysia would like to invite you to speak on bitcoin protocol could we have your email address to send the invitation pingback bitcoin jamesmath pingback fun economic reading muddyhorse farm and tech pingback bitcoin have some of us been had jim bennett pingback the bitcoin protocol infographic pingback i dont get bitcoin but i want to startupcafe david says march at pm hi what a great writeup as for your first authors question there are probably several less complex methods for confirmation but there is inherent security in the current approach which appears to organically solve the problem without risky reliance on factors and layers outside the network itself pingback daily btc pboc edition token intelligence pingback enter the blockchain how bitcoin can turn the cloud inside out techcrunch momingle says march at pm there is one part that i am not sure i understand for example let say miner a has on his queue transaction a b and c to validated on a new block is it possible miner b will have transaction b c and d in his queue but not a that he will validate in his new block assuming both solve the puzzle now both transactions b and c are in two different blocks will both blocks got accepted pingback quora nagaraj hubli says march at pm thanks for the writeup it helped my a lot in understanding the underlying tech of the bitcoin protocol cant wait for the next in series elvin says april at am the protocol rules in the bitcoin wiki are ambiguous when an incoming block designates as its predecessor a block somewhere down in the main branch what happens exactly the wiki can be interpreted in two ways nothing at all the incoming block is not added as the beginning of a side branch the incoming block is added as the possible beginning of a side branch but without any verification for the moment if that is the case then most blocks in the main branch should have many brothers elvin says april at am i have verified that the correct answer is i have also found what limits the number of brothers for a block miners stop mining as soon as they receive a valid node and therefore no new blocks are sent their neighbours do not relay the blocks they might have sent in the meantime sorry for asking fivebuckchuck says may at pm thanks for the write up how do transactions get organized into blocks are nodes broadcasting transacations or blocks number of transactions in a block is that hardcoded in the protocol in your example of hhello worldnonce is hello world a unique transaction or the whole block pingback bitcoin family tree randolog rich says may at am suppose bitcoin mining software always explored nonces starting with x then x x ldots if this is done by all or even just a substantial fraction of bitcoin miners then it creates a vulnerability namely its possible for someone to improve their odds of solving the proofofwork merely by starting with some other much larger nonce more generally it may be possible for attackers to exploit any systematic patterns in the way miners explore the space of nonces this is incorrect because the block hash is dependant on the contents of the block for there to be any possibility of a miner improving his odds through this method the miner must be mining the exact same block as someone else including not using his own address for coinbase and transaction fees to go to removing the entire incentive for mining comments are closed previous post neural networks and deep learning first chapter now live next post reinventing explanation ddi proudly powered by

posted by hours ago question as this space is changing so quickly im always looking for better ways to stay updated on the newest projectsprotocols that come out as i usually find quite a lot to learn from them i currently use defillama for this but i feel like there are better options what forums sites do you all use to quickly get updated on new stuff comments share save posted by hours ago question okay so hear me out i randomly get a text on whatsapp from a chinese girl who was supposedly trying to contact her driver to pick her up then she asks me my age and all that and we start talking a bit at this point im suspicious it might be a romance scam i called her though and she really is a female and does sound chinese and it doesnt sound like a voice changer or anything she also frequently changes her profile picture with selfies and i looked them up on google reverse image search and its not coming up with anything so i think that might really be her then we get to talking about hobbies and she says shes into crypto and investing and then i say hey me too and then she goes on about this supposed smart mining website which gives you returns per day of whatever you deposit her english is really bad but from what she explained it sounds like some sort of flashloan thing i checked the website in inspect element on google chrome and its full of chinese it also doesnt work or do anything on pc she told me i have to specifically download the mew wallet app and open the website in the mew apps browser here is the website ehahftop honestly it totally looks and feels like a scam and it probably is ive just never seen a scam like this before first of all this chinese girl somehow got my phone number and i dont live in the us so its pretty rare to get scam calls here and second she actually engaged in conversation and acted like my friend for a good days on whatsapp i dont know why shes so persistent or what she knows about me but please please please someone check the website and at least tell me what kind of scam it is because this is truly one of the weirdest encounters ive had in a long time i repeat she says it only works specifically if you open the website in the mew wallet apps browser but im not about to do it on my phone even with a fake wallet since who knows maybe its an exploit that hacks into my whole phone this does seem like a pretty advanced scam after all comments share save posted by hours ago question is there any way to currently tumble my funds open to creative methods using a nonkyc cex etc not doing anything sus but i just want a fresh wallet not attached to my identity as many people recognize my address comments share save posted by hours ago my project hey rethdev i did a quick project issues gm a feed of web technical issues that need attention the idea is simple for devs stay updated on technical issues in web projects for newcomers break into the industry by working on real technical issues rather than

the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site no we do not list all cryptocurrencies at coinmarketcap as a company and team we are very aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions while we cannot guarantee to exclude them all we have a vetting process that each coin goes through before it is listed on the site if we suspect that a coin or project is a scam it does not get listed at the time of writing we estimate that there are around coins tokens and projects in the global coin market as mentioned above we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed this process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site the very first cryptocurrency was bitcoin since it is open source it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency many people have done exactly this some of these coins are very similar to bitcoin with just one or two amended features such as litecoin while others are very different with varying models of security issuance and governance however they all share the same moniker every coin issued after bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin ico stands for initial coin offering many of the smaller projects in the crypto space and a few of the largest ones raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign investors would send funds usually in the form of bitcoin to the project and receive coin or tokens in return most icos happened in and early and used ethereum as a platform of operation via the erc standard in the united states securities and exchange commission sec clarified their rules relating to fundraising for assets which made it much harder for new cryptocurrency projects to issue their own tokens in this way since the appearance of the sec guidance and the organizations heightened interest in regulating icos for us citizens the number of icos has been reduced substantially price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market when asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed to overcome this problem a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies ranging from the us dollar other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies arose these new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due

detailed explanation can be found in here contract specifications what is the difference between portfolio margin and standard margin default standard margin favours following trade strategies options buying your long options could not be liquidated in standard margin directional positions especially big leverage and no hedging you will be able to get more leverage in such strategy advanced portfolio margin model takes into consideration positions in futures and options combined thus potentially reducing the margin requirements of a portfolio it is best used with the following strategies hedged positions trading constructions with multiple legs or just hedged positions can benefit from shared margin greatly allowing to lower margin requirements and either lower risk or use higher leverage by that so the difference between pm and sm is that portfolio mode looks at how the entire portfolio of positions would perform together with changing market conditions please note that in pm mode margin requirements of your positions would be affected by more parameters than simple price movement whichever of these scenarios would inflict the largest loss to your portfolio this loss amount is then used to calculate your margin requirements for a more detailed explanation please refer to the following article portfolio margin how can i make sure that my withdrawals would be

me powered by duckduckgo blog essays whole site the softwaredefined car developers are starting to talk about the softwaredefined car for decades features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles a box here to control the antilock brakes a module there to run the cruise control radar and so on now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers the behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software too this is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units today code controls a cars engine and transmission or its electric motors and battery pack the steering brakes suspension interior and exterior lighting and more depending on how new and how expensive it is and those systems are being leveraged for convenience or safety features like adaptive cruise control lane keeping remote parking and so on and security another advantage of the move away from legacy designs is that digital security can be baked in from the start rather than patched onto components like a cars central area network that were never designed with the internet in mind if you design it from scratch its security by design everything is in by design you have it there but keep in mind that of course the more software there is in the car the more risk is there for vulnerabilities no question about this anhalt said at the same time theyre a great software system theyre highly secure theyre much more secure than a hardware system with a little bit of software it depends how the whole thing has been designed and there are so many regulations and eu standards that have been released in the last year year and a half that force oems to comply with these standards and get security inside she said i suppose it could end up that way it could also be a much bigger attack surface with a lot more hacking possibilities tags cars cybersecurity hacking posted on june at am comments friday squid blogging squid chromolithographs beautiful illustrations as usual you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that i havent covered read my blog posting guidelines here edited to add slashdot thread tags squid posted on june at pm comments opensource llms in february meta released its large language model llama unlike openai and its chatgpt meta didnt just give the world a chat window to play with instead it released the code into the opensource community and shortly thereafter the model itself was leaked researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it improving it and getting it to do things no one else anticipated and their results have been immediate innovative and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out training speeds have hugely increased and the size of the models themselves has shrunk to the point that you can create and run them on a laptop the world of ai research has dramatically changed this development hasnt made the same splash as other corporate announcements but its effects will be much greater it will wrest power from the large tech corporations resulting in both much more innovation and a much more challenging regulatory landscape the large corporations that had controlled these models warn that this freeforall will lead to potentially dangerous developments and problematic uses of the open technology have already been documented but those who are working on the open models counter that a more democratic research environment is better than having this powerful technology controlled by a small number of corporations the power shift comes from simplification the llms built by openai and google rely on massive data sets measured in the tens of billions of bytes computed on by tens of thousands of powerful specialized processors producing models with billions of parameters the received wisdom is that bigger data bigger processing and larger parameter sets were all needed to make a better model producing such a model requires the resources of a corporation with the money and computing power of a google or microsoft or meta but building on public models like metas llama the opensource community has innovated in ways that allow results nearly as good as the huge modelsbut run on home machines with common data sets what was once the reserve of the resourcerich has become a playground for anyone with curiosity coding skills and a good laptop bigger may be better but the opensource community is showing that smaller is often good enough this opens the door to more efficient accessible and resourcefriendly llms more importantly these smaller and faster llms are much more accessible and easier to experiment with rather than needing tens of thousands of machines and millions of dollars to train a new model an existing model can now be customized on a midpriced laptop in a few hours this fosters rapid innovation it also takes control away from large companies like google and openai by providing access to the underlying code and encouraging collaboration opensource initiatives empower a diverse range of developers researchers and organizations to shape the technology this diversification of control helps prevent undue influence and ensures that the development and deployment of ai technologies align with a broader set of values and priorities much of the modern internet was built on opensource technologies from the lamp linux apache mysql and phpperlpython stacka suite of applications often used in web development this enabled sophisticated websites to be easily constructed all with opensource tools that were built by enthusiasts not companies looking for profit facebook itself was originally built using opensource php but being opensource also means that there is no one to hold responsible for misuse of the technology when vulnerabilities are discovered in obscure bits of opensource technology critical to the functioning of the internet often there is no entity responsible for fixing the bug opensource communities span countries and cultures making it difficult to ensure that any countrys laws will be respected by the community and having the technology opensourced means that those who wish to use it for unintended illegal or nefarious purposes have the same access to the technology as anyone else this in turn has significant implications for those who are looking to regulate this new and powerful technology now that the opensource community is remixing llms its no longer possible to regulate the technology by dictating what research and development can be done there are simply too many researchers doing too many different things in too many different countries the only governance mechanism available to governments now is to regulate usage and only for those who pay attention to the law or to offer incentives to those including startups individuals and small companies who are now the drivers of innovation in the arena incentives for these communities could take the form of rewards for the production of particular uses of the technology or hackathons to develop particularly useful applications sticks are hard to useinstead we need appealing carrots it is important to remember that the opensource community is not always motivated by profit the members of this community are often driven by curiosity the desire to experiment or the simple joys of building while there are companies that profit from supporting software produced by opensource projects like linux python or the apache web server those communities are not profit driven and there are many opensource models to choose from alpaca cerebrasgpt dolly huggingchat and stablelm have all been released in the past few months most of them are built on top of llama but some have other pedigrees more are on their way the large tech monopolies that have been developing and fielding llmsgoogle microsoft and metaare not ready for this a few weeks ago a google employee leaked a memo in which an engineer tried to explain to his superiors what an opensource llm means for their own proprietary tech the memo concluded that the opensource community has lapped the major corporations and has an overwhelming lead on them this isnt the first time companies have ignored the power of the opensource community sun never understood linux netscape never understood the apache web server open source isnt very good at original innovations but once an innovation is seen and picked up the community can be a pretty overwhelming thing the large companies may respond by trying to retrench and pulling their models back from the opensource community but its too late we have entered an era of llm democratization by showing that smaller models can be highly effective enabling easy experimentation diversifying control and providing incentives that are not profit motivated opensource initiatives are moving us into a more dynamic and inclusive ai landscape this doesnt mean that some of these models wont be biased or wrong or used to generate disinformation or abuse but it does mean that controlling this technology is going to take an entirely different approach than regulating the large players this essay was written with jim waldo and previously appeared on slatecom edited to add slashdot thread tags artificial intelligence essays meta open source posted on june at am comments on the catastrophic risk of ai earlier this week i signed on to a short group statement coordinated by the center for ai safety mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war the press coverage has been extensive and surprising to me the new york times headline is ai poses risk of extinction industry leaders warn bbc artificial intelligence could lead to extinction experts warn other headlines are similar i actually dont think that ai poses a risk to human extinction i think it poses a similar risk to pandemics and nuclear warwhich is to say a risk worth taking seriously but not something to panic over which is what i thought the statement said in my talk at the rsa conference last month i talked about the power level of our species becoming too great for our systems of governance talking about those systems i said now add into this mix the risks that arise from new and dangerous technologies such as the internet or ai or synthetic biology or molecular nanotechnology or nuclear weapons here misaligned incentives and hacking can have catastrophic consequences for society that was what i was thinking about when i agreed to sign on to the statement pandemics nuclear weapons aiyeah i would put those three in the same bucket surely we can spend the same effort on ai risk as we do on future pandemics thats a really low bar clearly i should have focused on the word extinction and not the relative comparisons seth lazar jeremy howard and arvind narayanan wrote we think that in fact most signatories to the statement believe that runaway ai is a way off yet and that it will take a significant scientific advance to get therene that we cannot anticipate even if we are confident that it will someday occur if this is so then at least two things follow i agree with that and with their follow up first we should give more weight to serious risks from ai that are more urgent even if existing ai systems and their plausible extensions wont wipe us out they are already causing much more concentrated harm they are sure to exacerbate inequality and in the hands of powerhungry governments and unscrupulous corporations will undermine individual and collective freedom this is what i wrote in click here to kill everybody i am less worried about ai i regard fear of ai more as a mirror of our own society than as a harbinger of the future ai and intelligent robotics are the culmination of several precursor technologies like machine learning algorithms automation and autonomy the security risks from those precursor technologies are already with us and theyre increasing as the technologies become more powerful and more prevalent so while i am worried about intelligent and even driverless cars most of the risks arealready prevalent in internetconnected drivered cars and while i am worried about robot soldiers most of the risks are already prevalent in autonomous weapons systems also as roboticist rodney brooks pointed out long before we see such machines arising there will be the somewhat less intelligent and belligerent machines before that there will be the really grumpy machines before that the quite annoying machines and before them the arrogant unpleasant machines i think well see any new security risks coming long before they get here i do think we should worry about catastrophic ai and robotics risk its the fact that they affect the world in a direct physical mannerand that theyre vulnerable to class breaks other things to read david chapman is good on scary ai and kieran healy is good on the statement okay enough i should also learn not to sign on to group statements tags artificial intelligence risk assessment risks posted on june at am comments chinese hacking of us critical infrastructure everyone is writing about an interagency and international report on chinese hacking of us critical infrastructure lots of interesting details about how the group called volt typhoon accesses target networks and evades detection tags china cyberattack cyberespionage espionage hacking infrastructure reports posted on may at am comments bruteforcing a fingerprint reader its neither hard nor expensive unlike password authentication which requires a direct match between what is inputted and whats stored in a database fingerprint authentication determines a match using a reference threshold as a result a successful fingerprint bruteforce attack requires only that an inputted image provides an acceptable approximation of an image in the fingerprint database bruteprint manipulates the false acceptance rate far to increase the threshold so fewer approximate images are accepted bruteprint acts as an adversary in the middle between the fingerprint sensor and the trusted execution environment and exploits vulnerabilities that allow for unlimited guesses in a bruteprint attack the adversary removes the back cover of the device and attaches the circuit board that has the fingerprint database loaded in the flash storage the adversary then must convert the database into a fingerprint dictionary thats formatted to work with the specific sensor used by the targeted phone the process uses a neuralstyle transfer when converting the database into the usable dictionary this process increases the chances of a match with the fingerprint dictionary in place the adversary device is now in a position to input each entry into the targeted phone normally a protection known as attempt limiting effectively locks a phone after a set number of failed login attempts are reached bruteprint can fully bypass this limit in the eight tested android models meaning the adversary device can try an infinite number of guesses on the two iphones the attack can expand the number of guesses to three times higher than the five permitted the bypasses result from exploiting what the researchers said are two zeroday vulnerabilities in the smartphone fingerprint authentication framework of virtually all smartphones the vulnerabilitiesone known as camf cancelaftermatch fail and the other mal matchafterlockresult from logic bugs in the authentication framework camf exploits invalidate the checksum of transmitted fingerprint data and mal exploits infer matching results through sidechannel attacks depending on the model the attack takes between minutes and hours also the ability of bruteprint to successfully hijack fingerprints stored on android devices but not iphones is the result of one simple design difference ios encrypts the data and android does not other news articles research paper

here tags squid posted on may at pm comments expeditionary cyberspace operations cyberspace operations now officially has a physical dimension meaning that the united states has official military doctrine about cyberattacks that also involve an actual human gaining physical access to a piece of computing infrastructure a revised version of joint publication cyberspace operationspublished in december and while unclassified is only available to those with dod common access cards according to a joint staff spokespersonofficially provides a definition for expeditionary cyberspace operations which are cyberspace operations that require the deployment of cyberspace forces within the physical domains developing access to targets in or through cyberspace follows a process that can often take significant time in some cases remote access is not possible or preferable and close proximity may be required using expeditionary cyber operations the joint publication states such operations are key to addressing the challenge of closed networks and other systems that are virtually isolated expeditionary co are often more regionally and tactically focused and can include units of the cmf or special operations forces if direct access to the target is unavailable or undesired sometimes a similar or partial effect can be created by indirect access using a related target that has higherorder effects on the desired target allowing them to support combatant commands in this way permits faster adaptation to rapidly changing needs and allows threats that initially manifest only in one area of responsibility to be mitigated globally in near real time likewise while synchronizing co missions related to achieving combatant commander objectives some cyberspace capabilities that support this activity may need to be forwarddeployed used in multiple aors simultaneously or for speed in timecritical situations made available via reachback it states this might involve augmentation or deployment of cyberspace capabilities to forces already forward or require expeditionary co by deployment of a fully equipped team of personnel and capabilities tags cyberattack cyberwar national

the strong incentives the blackhat seo crowd has to manipulate results its entirely possible that bad actors have been poisoning chatgpt for months we dont know because openai doesnt talk about their processes how they validate the prompts they use for training how they vet their training data set or how they finetune chatgpt their secrecy means we dont know if chatgpt has been safely managed theyll also have to update their training data set at some point they cant leave their models stuck in forever once they do update it we only have their word pinkyswear promises that theyve done a

affiliates pricing buy online buy from local partner renew license search for malware lab ransomware senan conrad february min read most recent latest videos protection guides malware lab emsisoft news enterprise security alphv is a ransomware variant that encrypts data on infected systems and threatens to leak stolen data if the ransom payment is not made it is highly customizable which enables threat actors to easily tailor an attack to the target environment alphv was first observed in november and is believed to be the first active ransomware coded in the rust programming language what is alphv alphv is a strain of ransomware that encrypts files using aes encryption although the process can be overridden to use chacha and demands a large ransom for their decryption it is the only active ransomware developed using rust a programming language renowned for its performance and safety alphv has used rusts crossplatform capabilities to develop both linux and windows variants of the ransomware alphv is categorized as ransomwareasaservice raas a business model whereby the developers of the ransomware lease it to affiliates who earn a portion of ransom payments in exchange for executing a successful attack alphv offers affiliates a larger revenue share than many other raas operations with affiliates earning of payments up to million of payments up to million and of payments over million the developers of alphv typically recruit affiliates on russianspeaking hacking forums to amplify the impact of an attack alphv uses data exfiltration to put further pressure on victims and increase their chances of a payout during an attack threat actors extract large amounts of data from the compromised system and threaten to publish it on the alphv leak site unless the victim pays the ransom alphv is one of a handful of ransomware groups that also threatens to ddos victims that fail to pay the ransom alphv allegedly uses its own botnet to manually perform the ddos attacks the group frames ddos as an exclusive feature of sorts available only to affiliates who have generated more than million in ransom payments the history of alphv alphv was first detected in november and quickly claimed dozens of victims in the first few months of operation it is likely that alphv is a rebrand of a ransomware group known as blackmatter which was itself a rebrand of a group known as darkside its believed that these rebranding efforts may be an attempt by threat actors to distance themselves from  a costly development blunder that allowed emsisoft to create a free blackmatter decryption tool cybersecurity researchers originally named the ransomware blackcat after the image of an inky feline that was depicted on every victims tor payment site however in february a representative of the group confirmed that its only official name is alphv since alphv was first discovered there have been submissions to id ransomware an online tool that helps the victims of ransomware identify which ransomware has encrypted their files we estimate that only percent of victims make a submission to id ransomware which means there may have been a total of alphv incidents since the ransomwares inception during this time the group also published on its leak site the stolen data of at least organizations alphv ransom note after the ransomware has been deployed and the encryption process is complete alphv drops a ransom note on the infected system the ransom note is named after the apparently random file extension that alphv appends to all encrypted files and uses the following naming format recoverrandom extensionfilestxt the ransom note informs the target that their files have been encrypted and includes a link to a onion site where the victim can make payment the note also includes examples of the type of data that was stolen during the attack along with threats that the data will be published if the victim refuses to cooperate below is a sample alphv ransom note introduction important files on your system was encrypted and now they have redacted extension in order to recover your files you need to follow instructions below sensitive data sensitive data on your system was downloaded and it will be published if you refuse to cooperate data includes redacted and more private preview is published here redacted caution do not modify files yourself do not use third party software to restore your data you may damage your files it will result in permanent data loss your data is strongly encrypted you can not decrypt it without cipher key recovery procedure follow these simple steps to get in touch and recover your data download and install tor browser from httpstorprojectorg navigate to redacted who does alphv target alphv tends to target large organizations with the resources and motivation to pay large ransom demands it is capable of infecting both windows and linux systems alphv prohibits attacks on nations belonging to the commonwealth of independent states cis which includes azerbaijan armenia belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova russia tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and ukraine the group also prohibits attacks on government healthcare and educational institutions if an entity belonging to one of these sectors is attacked alphv claims that it will provide free decryption and ban the offending affiliate as always any claims made by cybercrime groups should be taken with a grain of salt alphv has already published stolen data from at least one victim in the healthcare sector the group has stated that its rules around avoiding the healthcare sector do not apply to pharmaceutical companies and private clinics additionally even if the group does provide free decryption to an impacted entity the recovery process may still take days weeks or months to complete this level of disruption can have a significant impact on patient health how does alphv spread alphv attacks begin by breaching the target network affiliates can use a variety of methods to infect the target system including compromised rdp phishing attacks stolen credentials and exploiting known vulnerabilities once the system has been compromised attackers may use a variety of tools to prepare the environment for encryption and maximize the impact of the attack tools such as mimikatz lazagne and webbrowserpassview are used to access saved passwords which enable threat actors to escalate privileges and spread laterally across the network megasync is often used to exfiltrate data while antiforensics tools like file shredder are sometimes used to securely delete files and thwart analysis powershell is often used to modify windows defender security settings and shadow volume copies are deleted prior to encryption to prevent organisations from restoring encrypted files alphv requires a specific access token for the ransomware to execute properly the access token acts as a unique key which is used to verify the identification of the victim and must be provided when accessing the alphv onion payment site the access token prevents thirdparties such as ransomware researchers gatecrashing what is supposed to be a private negotiation between victim and attacker as alphv operates as a raas and can be distributed by many different affiliates the exact anatomy of an attack can vary from incident to incident major alphv attacks oiltanking in late november german petrol distributor oiltanking gmbh was the victim of an alphv attack the incident affected fuel terminals including the automated systems responsible for loading and unloading fuel tanks and forced the company to resort to manual processes more than petrol stations mostly located in northern germany were impacted during the attack swissport in february swissport the worlds leading provider of ground services and cargo handling for the aviation industry was allegedly hit by alphv the group posted on its data leak site a small sample of files that were apparently stolen during the attack including passports internal business notes and the personal information of job candidates the group also offered to sell the entire tb set of stolen data how to protect the network from alphv and other ransomware the following practices may help organizations reduce the risk of an alphv incident cybersecurity awareness training because the majority of ransomware spreads through userinitiated actions organizations should implement training initiatives that focus on teaching end users the fundamentals of cybersecurity ransomware and propagation methods are constantly evolving so training must be an ongoing process to ensure endusers are across current threats credential hygiene practicing good credential hygiene can help prevent brute force attacks mitigate the effects of credential theft and reduce the risk of unauthorized network access multifactor authentication mfa provides an extra layer of security that can help prevent unauthorized access to accounts tools systems and data repositories organizations should consider enabling mfa wherever possible security patches organizations of all sizes should have a robust patch management strategy that ensures security updates on all endpoints servers and appliances are applied as soon as possible to minimize the window of opportunity for an attack backups backups are one of the most effective ways of mitigating the effects of a ransomware incident many strains of ransomware can spread laterally across the network and encrypt locally stored backups so organizations should use a mixture of media storage and store backup copies both on and offsite see this guide for more information on creating ransomwareproof backups system hardening hardening networks servers operating systems and applications is crucial for reducing attack surface and managing potential security vulnerabilities disabling unneeded and potentially exploitable services such as powershell rdp windows script host microsoft office macros etc reduces the risk of initial infection while implementing the principle of least privilege can help prevent lateral movement block macros many ransomware families are delivered via macroembedded microsoft office or pdf documents organizations should review their use of macros consider blocking all macros from the internet and only allow vetted and approved macros to execute from trusted locations email authentication organizations can use a variety of email authentication techniques such as sender policy framework domainkeys identified mail and domainbased message authentication reporting and conformance to detect email spoofing and identify suspicious messages network segregation effective network segregation helps contain incidents prevents the spread of malware and reduces disruption to the wider business network monitoring organizations of all sizes must have systems in place to monitor possible data exfiltration channels and respond immediately to suspicious activity penetration testing penetration testing can be useful for revealing vulnerabilities in it infrastructure and employees susceptibility to ransomware results of the test can be used to allocate it resources and inform future cybersecurity decisions incident response plan organizations should have a comprehensive incident response plan in place that details exactly what to do in the event of infection a swift response can help prevent malware from spreading minimize disruption and ensure the incident is remediated as efficiently as possible how to remove alphv and other ransomware alphv uses encryption methods that currently make it impossible to decrypt data without paying for an attackersupplied decryption tool did your antivirus let you down we wont download your free trial of emsisoft antimalware and see for yourself start free trial victims of alphv should be prepared to restore their systems from backups using processes that should be defined in the organizations incident response plan the following actions are recommended take action to contain the threat determine the extent of the infection identify the source of the infection collect evidence restore the system from backups ensure all devices on the network are clean perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the attack vector the scope of the incident and the extent of data exfiltration identify and strengthen vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of a repeat incident senan conrad as a

doubt in the security community that the former members of darkside blackmatter and revil have formed the core of alphv a more mature due to their experience and sophisticated affiliate program security researchers unofficially call it blackcat for its use of two logos a black cat and a knife dripping with blood alphv members later attempted to move away from romanticizing crime by changing the design of their logo but the name blackcat has stuck images used by alphv in the beginning updated logo despite its short history the group has conducted about attacks worldwide over the course of six months and has set a new direction for the development of extortionrelated crime many affiliate programs such as hive started mimicking and adopting the methods and approaches of blackcat this blog post describes the details of this affiliate program and analyzes what exactly affiliates do after obtaining access to the networks of their victims alphv started its activity in december when a campaign to attract new affiliates started to be advertised on underground forums description of the affiliate program on an underground forum translation arrow_drop_down intro welcome to our affiliate program weve taken into account all the advantages and weaknesses of previous affiliate programs and are proud to present to you alphv a new generation of ransomware all the software has been developed from scratch with decentralization of all web resources ensured architecturally a unique onion domain is generated for every new campaign every affiliate has access through a unique onion domain hello lockbit a proprietary data center for storing file leaks bigger than tb top recovery companies which have worked with darkside revil etc are already collaborating with us chat support is available but you can negotiate yourself if youd like security we are fully prepared for presentday conditions complying with all infrastructure and affiliate security requirements our affiliate program architecturally rules out any connections with forumshello revil has algorithms for data selfdeletion after a certain time and has an integrated mixer with an actual break in the chainnot to be confused with wasabi bitmix and others as you get perfectly clean coins from foreign exchanges our backend does not know the wallets your coins are sent to the infrastructure is divided into nodes which are interconnected via an entire network of intermediaries within the onion network and are located behind natfw even after receiving a fullon cmdshell the attacker cannot reveal the real ip address of the server hello conti account if your account has not been active for two weeks it will be locked then deleted inorder to avoid that we recommend notifying the admins about vacations breaks etc rates are dynamic and depend on the size of a single payment for each company namely up to m up to m m and more in this campaign potential affiliates were offered a brand new kind of ransomware family developed from scratch in the rust programming language which is a popular crossplatform programming language for creating secure and effective applications the use of rust to create ransomware was a major event in the world of cybercrime description of the blackcat ransomware family translation arrow_drop_down software the software has been developed from scratch without using any templates or leaked source codes of other ransomware you can choose between encryption modes full full file encryption the most secure and the slowest fast encryption of the first n megabytes not recommended the least secure option but the fastest dotpattern encryption of n megabytes with an m interval may function worse than fast in terms of both speed and encryption strength if configured incorrectly auto depending on the file type and size the lockerboth in windows and nix esxi chooses the most optimalin terms of the speed security ratio strategy for processing files smartpattern encryption of n megabytes with a percentage interval by default it encrypts with megabyte blocks with an interval of of the file starting with the header the most optimal mode in terms of the speedencryption strength ratio encryption algorithms chacha aes in auto mode the software determines the presence of hardware support for aespresent in all modern processors and uses it if there is no aes support the software encrypts files using chacha the software is crossplatform ie if you mount windows disks in linux or vice versa the decryptor will be able to decrypt files supported oss the entire windows line from windows and above we tested it on r xp and can be encrypted through smb esxi tested on u debian tested on ubuntu tested on readynas synology it was clear from the very beginning of the new raas program that its creators were not new to the criminal business and took into account the negative experience of their predecessors namely the darkside blackmatter and revil affiliate programs after their notorious attacks against major companies these groups came under the spotlight of security researchers and law enforcers who together with samples obtained access to victims personal pages containing correspondence with threat actors where they often interfered information about using access tokens translation arrow_drop_down since binaries have been leaking to analysts lately and vt premium lets you download samples and get readmes random people may appear in chats and disrupt negotiations hello darkside when launching the software you must use the flag accesstoken cmdline arguments are not passed to avs which will ensure that your correspondence with the victim is confidential for the same reason every encrypted computer generates a unique id used for dividing chats there is a feature for uploading files from the mega service you provide a link to files and they are automatically uploaded to your servers the complete description of all features can be found in the faq section to avoid previous mistakes the blackcat authors fitted ransomware with a mandatory command line parameter containing an access token which is provided by the raas owners to their affiliates together with their ransomware suite the ransomware uses the access token to calculate determine the access key which is added to a tor link for the victim to access their page contents of the help text file provided to raas affiliates this link is saved in the ransom note which is created as a text file in each catalog with encrypted files ransom note when victims publish information from their chats blackcat affiliates punish them by increasing ransom demands for example at the start of their activity the threat actors were even more radical for instance they deleted the victims encryption keys to intimidate future victims information about deleting the encryption keys of a victim published by blackcat operators victims personal page blackcat affiliates use the double and triple extortion techniques firstly the stolen information is published on blackcats dedicated leak site dls secondly to mount pressure on the victim blackcat affiliates may threaten to send sensitive data to the victims competitors partners or customers mass media law enforcement etc thirdly the victim may receive threats of a ddos attack being launched against their infrastructure chat with a victim at the time of writing the stolen documents of affected companies that refused to pay a ransom were published on blackcats dls we estimate that the overall number of blackcat victims since december is about blackcats dls to reconstruct the lifecycle of a blackcat attack we use the unified ransomware kill chain described in incident response techniques for ransomware attacks gaining access to the network since a single affiliate program may involve different threat actors techniques used for obtaining initial access may differ further affiliates may use the services of initial access brokers who sell access to companies compromised infrastructures as part of investigating security incidents we have seen the following techniques exploiting publicfacing applications this technique gained popularity in among both affiliates and initial access brokers due to a lot of vulnerabilities being discovered that allowed arbitrary code execution in a variety of applications in the case of blackcat the attackers exploited a set of vulnerabilities known as proxyshell cve cve cve which enabled them to place a web shell on a vulnerable microsoft exchange server and then conduct postexploitation activities using remote access tools access via publicly accessible terminal servers remains the most popular technique for gaining initial access and blackcat affiliates used it in some cases in addition to terminal servers access to the target infrastructure could be gained via a vpn many organizations still do not use multifactor authentication which enables ransomware operators to easily use accounts whose data have been stolen using stealers for example having obtained initial access the attackers copy a set of tools in full or in part to the compromised host and seek to ensure persistence and gain access to privileged accounts to be able to move across the network to have additional capabilities to access the compromised network the attackers could use tunnels built using ngrok or gost or legitimate software such as teamviewer or screenconnect in some cases affiliates used cobalt strike a framework that many are already used to seeing when investigating ransomware attacks in most incidents blackcat affiliates relied on legitimate tools to extract authentication data by dumping the lsass local security authority server service process for instance the threat actors used procdump and exploited the minidump feature of the legitimate library comsvcsdll sometimes the attackers went beyond lsass and used various nirsoft tools to extract authentication data from the registry web browsers and other storage spaces affiliates seldom used innovative methods at the data collection stage relying on classic tools for instance to scan the network the attackers used softperfect network scanner which is another tool many ransomware groups use extensively to collect information about active directory the attackers used adrecon a tool that is popular among revil and blackmatter affiliates in addition the ns tool was used to collect data about available local and network drives the tool was especially popular with those affiliates that used terminal servers to gain initial access with enough privileges in the target it infrastructure the attackers start moving to key nodes which will enable them to download the most important information and do away with backups to move across the network affiliates may use both perfectly legitimate techniques such as rdp and noisier ones eg impacket wmiexec and smbexec in particular and cobalt strike putty is often used to gain access to the part of the infrastructure running on linux before being exfiltrated data is put into archives using zip then uploaded to the mega file sharing service using the rclone utility in addition in some cases affiliates used exmatter an exfiltration tool that has earlier been seen in the arsenal of blackmatter affiliate program members blackcat ransomware deployment is preceded by the erasure or encryption of available backup copies and collection of additional credentials that would allow the attackers to infect the linux segment in addition to windows despite the detectability of blackcat samples not being high some affiliates seek to disable antivirus software before moving on to the deployment stage the propagation of blackcat in the victims it infrastructure is achieved by either modifying group policies which results in a scheduled task being created on each host that launches the malicious file or using psexec the ransomware is written in rust many researchers rightfully consider blackcat as one of the most sophisticated ransomware groups out there at the moment blackcat programs are featurerich and offer flexible custom settings due to the use of various configuration data and command line arguments there are blackcat versions for windows bit and linux bit and bit the bit linux version primarily targets esxi servers in march a new version of blackcat emerged called alphv morph on underground forums its authors proudly claimed that thanks to obfuscation antivirus software is practically unable to detect it description of alphv morphv features on an underground forum translation arrow_drop_down locker we are proud to present alphv morph without going into the spicy details we inform that the binary is completely cleared every hour in addition to recrypting calls stings and other things the rust compiler makes it possible to enrich every build with unique runtime junk which in the end yielded fantastic results at the moment no av detects itnot to be confused with edr we did not test it on sentinel including defender with the cloud disabled the binary is not deleted even after the machine is fully encrypted in test mode so far intentionally it is available to everyone via buildobfuscated in the future this functionality will only be available to affiliates with the status minor fixes in the lockers operation ps there is no av for esxi yet but we already have a linux polymorph thats right linux is also morphed every hour just because we can it has been mentioned before that launching blackcat ransomware requires specifying the value of an access token in the command line parameter accesstoken in earlier versions whether the token value is correct is not checked in any way while the access key is calculated using the entered token value the program will be launched and files will be encrypted but accessing the victims panel would be impossible in the alphv morph version the first characters of the access token are used as a key to decrypt configuration data which is why if incorrect data is entered the ransomware will not start to bypass user account control uac blackcat escalates privileges using the icmluautil com interface in addition privileges can be escalated using the masquerade peb method blackcat ransomware may attempt to authenticate using stolen credentials contained in configuration data when launched blackcat allows symbolic links from a deleted item to local and remote items fsutil behavior set symlinkevaluation

share on reddit email this post copy link in recent months we have observed in our telemetry an increase in ransomware that targets esxi servers since virtualization is the foundation of any largescale deployment of computing and storage resources it is not surprising that ransomware actors have now expanded their targets to include virtualization servers with a single attack it is possible to shut down entire data centers and affect virtualized storage that is shared among workloads with devastating effects in the following we provide a comprehensive overview of the families of ransomware that target esxi servers the ransomware called babuk appeared in the beginning of babuks builder which leaked to the public later that year was used to generate windows and linux executables and it included the vmware esxi encryptor the full source code of this ransomware was published by the author on one of the hacker forums later that year the only parameter the esxi encryptor expects during execution is the path to the target directory it scans the directory for the presence of files with log vmdk vmem vswp and vmsn extensions once it finds them it encrypts them with the stream cipher sosemanuk babuk drops a text file how to restore your filestxt with a ransom note in every folder containing encrypted files interestingly babuk does not shut down the esxi virtual machines before encrypting their files this may cause file corruption or lead to the inability to decrypt files iocs faccebfebfacdbeaeeebfebaf builder dcdbfbbacfbeddfaaaffdfdeceb esxi encryptor avoslocker specifically targeting windows machines was discovered in one year later in the beginning of its linux variant targeting vmware esxi instances was discovered as for many other ransomware families avoslockers selling model is ransomwareasaservice raas if the target directory for the esxi encryptor is vmfsvolumes then the tool searches only for files with log vmdk vmem vswp vmsn extensions otherwise it recursively encrypts all files in the given directory before the file encryption starts avoslocker shuts down the esxi virtual machines using the esxcli commandline utility avoslocker uses a combination of the stream cipher salsa and rsa when the encryption is completed it appends the avoslinux or avos extension to the filename at the end it drops a text file readme_for_restore which contains a ransom note iocs cdbeaceacecacfecfdcfcb blackcat also known as alphv is the first widely known ransomware written in the rust programming language its appearance in late was highlighted by the ability to target many platforms including vmware esxi blackcat operates under the ransomwareasaservice raas model like many other ransomware families for encryption blackcat has chosen a combination of the stream cipher salsa and rsa before starting the encryption blackcat shuts down the virtual machines with the esxcli commandline utility the tool targets files with all extensions the extension that the ransomware adds to the names of the encrypted files looks like a random combination of alphabetic characters and digits and it is always specific to the system examples of the extensions are dkrpx khftzx and wpzlbji after encryption the tool drops a text file recover xxxxxxx filestxt with a ransom note xxxxxxx is the extension added to encrypted files iocs aebfecdbdbeceaceaaebcdefaedfce the hive ransomware group working under the raas model was discovered in june four months later in october the first variant targeting vmware esxi written in golang was observed according to eset the sample couldnt run properly following the blackcats trend around march the authors of hive ported their product to the rust programming language iocs aabdcbdadeeafeeaffefcec eebecdfbfdaebbeaeccfbedcb the luna ransomware appeared in july unlike its competitors this threat targeted vmware esxi instances from the day it started operating the luna threat actors chose the crossplatform programming language rust to develop its ransomware components similar to other ransomware threats luna operates as raas the esxi encryptor targets all folders and files except for the set of those that can be found only on windows openserver windows program files recyclebin programdata appdata all users ini dll exe lnk for file encryption the ransomware uses a combination of x and aes unlike most of the competitors luna does not shut down the virtual machines which may lead to file corruption or inability to decrypt the encrypted files when the file is encrypted luna appends the luna extension to the files name and then creates a text file readmelunatxt with a ransom note iocs cbbffcfbabdedcadccfdbebfbecfab revil aka sodinokibi is one of the most notorious ransomware gangs it was formed in and since then operated following the raas model in june the ransomware started targeting vmware esxi instances the alleged authors were arrested by the russian authorities in january but as of today september the gang is still believed to be active revils esxi encryptor can be executed without parameters it will then immediately start encrypting all files in the current directory before encrypting the files the tool tries to shut down the virtual machines with the esxcli commandline utility when the files are encrypted it appends a specific extension to the files name eg rhkrc qoxaq naixq in the folder where the encrypted files are locates it also drops the xxxxxreadmetxt file with a ransom note the xxxx string is replaced with the chosen random extension iocs eabecbabcecaceebaedbbfbc the hellokitty ransomware emerged in late unlike most families which operate under the ransomware as a service raas model hellokitty is used exclusively by the gang vicesociety who targets companies using humanoperated doubleextortion campaigns in july an encryptor that targeted explicitly vmware esxi systems was discovered the target path must be given to the esxi encryptor as a parameter during execution before the file encryption starts the tool tries to shut down the virtual machines with the esxcli commandline utility for file encryption the tool uses a combination of the symmetric key encryption cipher aes and the public key encryption cipher rsa after the file is encrypted hellokitty appends the crypt extension to the files name and then drops a file_nametmpreadme_to_restore with a ransom note in the same folder where the file resides iocs fdbffadadeadaddbcdbbcdfbacab the first samples of the black basta ransomware date back to february five months later in june the gang released a new encryptor targeting vmware esxi the ransomware operates following the raas model being executed without parameters the esxi encryptor starts encrypting all files in the vmfsvolumes folder where the files of the esxi virtual machines reside the encryptor uses a combination of the stream cipher chacha and rsa after encryption the tool adds the basta extension to the encrypted file and then drops a readmetxt text file with a ransom note unlike most of the esxi encryptors black basta does not shut down the virtual machines prior to encryption which may lead to file corruption and inability to decrypt the encrypted files iocs dcdeaebbbededfbbdcfcebadebfbfcef the actors behind darkside initially distributed revil ransomware but grew tired of sharing the profits with the revil ransomwareasaservice raas operator so decided to create their own ransomware the darkside ransomware has been used to target a wide variety of organizations across north america and europe most famously the us fuel distribution company colonial pipeline was held ransom by darkside dramatically affecting gasoline distribution on the east coast darkside initially targeted windows hosts but quickly evolved to include linux targets and in particular those running on esxi servers these servers are usually targeted after the threat actors gain access to a vmware vcenter deployment often by means of stolen credentials the darkside ransomware uses the chacha and rsa cyphers for encryption and adds a darkside extension to the files eventually dropping a ransom note named darkside_readmetxt blackmatter is considered an evolution of the darkside ransomware interestingly the actors behind blackmatter made sure to publicly announce that they were not targeting specific verticals such as healthcare oil and gas government and critical infrastructure companies possibly following the backlash that the colonial pipeline attack created and the unwanted attention that the darkside operators received iocs cefcebeaeefadfcbbeece cccefacdddaedfffbacffb ceabfbcccbddefccdbfdceafdcb dabbfbaddffcaabdbdcedfccffaab defray is a linuxbased commandline driven ransomware that employs traditional methods for enumerating folders and files on a system and then encrypts them using hardcoded encryption keys typically this malware requires a set of command line arguments that specify the folder in which the ransomware should start its encryption the malware then enumerates through all folders and files in the specified directory targeting files names that do not contain the encrypted extension nor file names that match the ransom note filename finally the ransom note is created and written on the filesystem analysis of the code within the defray malware suggests that it is an evolution of the ransomexx ransomware threat this is based partially on the similarities of hardcoded data but also very similar programming styles iocs cbdafaefcfcabfbdeebbc gwisinlocker a ransomware targeting companies exclusively in south korea was discovered in july it supports both windows and linux systems the latter variant is targeting also the vmware esxi systems being executed without parameters the esxi encryptor starts encrypting all files in the system it has the ability to shut down the virtual machines this feature is not active by default gwisinlocker combines the symmetric cipher aes and rsa after the file is encrypted it adds the extension which consists out of random characters to the files name and then creates another file with the same name and zero character appended where it stores the encrypted aes key for the encrypted file afterwards it creates the _how_to_unlock_xxxxx_files_txt text file with a ransom note where xxxxx is the appended extension iocs bfddbeefbbeccffacabddeeb the cheerscrypt ransomware was discovered in may the code of cheerscrypt showed many similarities with the code of babuk specifically its esxi encryptor its no surprise that the authors of cheerscrypt took the babuks c code as the basis for their project one of the key differences from babuk is that prior to file encryption cheerscrypt shuts down the virtual machines with help of the esxcli commandline utility for file encryption cheerscrypt uses a combination of the stream cipher sosemanuk and ecdh similar to what babuk does after encryption the tool appends the cheers extension to the files name and then drops the text file how to restore your filestxt with a ransom note iocs unavailable at the time of writing the redalert ransomware targeting vmware esxi was discovered in july unlike its competitors it can be configured using a number of parameters for example w parameter can be used to stop all running virtual machines with the help of the esxcli commandline utility while r can be used to enable the recursive encryption mode one interesting feature of the encryptor which differentiates it from the other ransomware samples is that it requires root privileges before any encryption attempt it tries to drop a configuration file to the root directory and fails to do so when running under the privileges of a normal user the encryptor is targeting files with log vmdk vmem vswp vmsn extensions only for encryption it uses a combination of aes and the public key cryptosystem ntruencrypt which is unusual after the file is encrypted it adds the cryptnumber extension to the files name and then drops the how_to_restore text file with a ransom note iocs edecdecadeabfeadbbdebdcbebae lockbit became one of the most prolific ransomware families known today discovered in it operates under the raas model its vmware esxi encryptor component is one of the oldest and was discovered back in october the tool is able to shut down virtual machines by executing the esxcli commandline utility and it uses a combination of aes and ecc curve for encryption this ransomware tool appends the lockbit extension to the files name and then drops a text file with a ransom note iocs faedbcfffaadfedeecaffdea the conti ransomware appeared in december like many other ransomware families it operates following the raas model in march the source code of the windows version of the ransomware and the builder as well as the gang members chats were leaked exposing their conversation about plans to build an esxi encryptor one month later in april the esxi encryptor was discovered the esxi encryptor requires the target directory to be specified all files in that directory will be encrypted the tool is also able shut down virtual machines prior encryption with help of the esxcli commandline utility for file encryption the tool uses a combination of the stream cipher salsa and rsa after encryption it appends the conti extension to the filenames and then drops the text file readmetxt with a ransom note iocs fcbcacebfedadabffbfdbcfafdba ransomware can be a

update new information about recent qakbot campaigns leading to ransomware deployment july update new information about devassociated activity wherein existing raspberry robin infections are used to deploy fakeupdates which then leads to followon actions resembling dev june update more details in the threat actors and campaigns section including recently observed activities from dev trickbot llc dev dev dev and a new section on qakbot campaigns that lead to ransomware deployments microsoft processes trillion signals every hours and we have blocked billions of attacks in the last year alone microsoft security tracks more than unique ransomware families and unique threat actors across observed nationstate ransomware and criminal activities that depth of signal intelligence gathered from various domainsidentity email data and cloudprovides us with insight into the gig economy that attackers have created with tools designed to lower the barrier for entry for other attackers who in turn continue to pay dividends and fund operations through the sale and associated cut from their tools success the cybercriminal economy is a continuously evolving connected ecosystem of many players with different techniques goals and skillsets in the same way our traditional economy has shifted toward gig workers for efficiency criminals are learning that theres less work and less risk involved by renting or selling their tools for a portion of the profits than performing the attacks themselves this industrialization of the cybercrime economy has made it easier for attackers to use readymade penetration testing and other tools to perform their attacks within this category of threats microsoft has been tracking the trend in the ransomware as a service raas gig economy called humanoperated ransomware which remains one of the most impactful threats to organizations we coined the industry term humanoperated ransomware to clarify that these threats are driven by humans who make decisions at every stage of their attacks based on what they find in their targets network unlike the broad targeting and opportunistic approach of earlier ransomware infections attackers behind these humanoperated campaigns vary their attack patterns depending on their discoveriesfor example a security product that isnt configured to prevent tampering or a service thats running as a highly privileged account like a domain admin attackers can use those weaknesses to elevate their privileges to steal even more valuable data leading to a bigger payout for themwith no guarantee theyll leave their target environment once theyve been paid attackers are also often more determined to stay on a network once they gain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize that access with additional attacks using different malware or ransomware payloads if they arent successfully evicted ransomware attacks have become even more impactful in recent years as more ransomware as a service ecosystems have adopted the double extortion monetization strategy all ransomware is a form of extortion but now attackers are not only encrypting data on compromised devices but also exfiltrating it and then posting or threatening to post it publicly to pressure the targets into paying the ransom most ransomware attackers opportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they get access to and some even purchase access to networks from other cybercriminals some attackers prioritize organizations with higher revenues while others prefer specific industries for the shock value or type of data they can exfiltrate all humanoperated ransomware campaignsall humanoperated attacks in general for that mattershare common dependencies on security weaknesses that allow them to succeed attackers most commonly take advantage of an organizations poor credential hygiene and legacy configurations or misconfigurations to find easy entry and privilege escalation points in an environment in this blog we detail several of the ransomware ecosystems  using the raas model the importance of crossdomain visibility in finding and evicting these actors and best practices organizations can use to protect themselves from this increasingly popular style of attack we also offer security best practices on credential hygiene and cloud hardening how to address security blind spots harden internetfacing assets to understand your perimeter and more heres a quick table of contents how raas redefines our understanding of ransomware incidents the raas affiliate model explained access for sale and mercurial targeting humanoperated means human decisions exfiltration and double extortion persistent and sneaky access methods threat actors and campaigns deep dive threat intelligencedriven response to humanoperated ransomware attacks defending against ransomware moving beyond protection by detection building credential hygiene auditing credential exposure prioritizing deployment of active directory updates cloud hardening addressing security blind spots reducing the attack surface hardening internetfacing assets and understanding your perimeter with ransomware being the preferred method for many cybercriminals to monetize attacks humanoperated ransomware remains one of the most impactful threats to organizations today and it only continues to evolve this evolution is driven by the humanoperated aspect of these attacksattackers make informed and calculated decisions resulting in varied attack patterns tailored specifically to their targets and iterated upon until the attackers are successful or evicted in the past weve observed a tight relationship between the initial entry vector tools and ransomware payload choices in each campaign of one strain of ransomware the raas affiliate model which has allowed more criminals regardless of technical expertise to deploy ransomware built or managed by someone else is weakening this link as ransomware deployment becomes a gig economy it has become more difficult to link the tradecraft used in a specific attack to the ransomware payload developers reporting a ransomware incident by assigning it with the payload name gives the impression that a monolithic entity is behind all attacks using the same ransomware payload and that all incidents that use the ransomware share common techniques and infrastructure however focusing solely on the ransomware stage obscures many stages of the attack that come before including actions like data exfiltration and additional persistence mechanisms as well as the numerous detection and protection opportunities for network defenders we know for example that the underlying techniques used in humanoperated ransomware campaigns havent changed very much over the yearsattacks still prey on the same security misconfigurations to succeed securing a large corporate network takes disciplined and sustained focus but theres a high roi in implementing critical controls that prevent these attacks from having a wider impact even if its only possible on the most critical assets and segments of the network without the ability to steal access to highly privileged accounts attackers cant move laterally spread ransomware widely access data to exfiltrate or use tools like group policy to impact security settings disrupting common attack patterns by applying security controls also reduces alert fatigue in security socs by stopping the attackers before they get in this can also prevent unexpected consequences of shortlived breaches such as exfiltration of network topologies and configuration data that happens in the first few minutes of execution of some trojans in the following sections we explain the raas affiliate model and disambiguate between the attacker tools and the various threat actors at play during a security incident gaining this clarity helps surface trends and common attack patterns that inform defensive strategies focused on preventing attacks rather than detecting ransomware payloads threat intelligence and insights from this research also enrich our solutions like microsoft defender whose comprehensive security capabilities help protect customers by detecting raasrelated attack attempts the cybercriminal economya connected ecosystem of many players with different techniques goals and skillsetsis evolving the industrialization of attacks has progressed from attackers using offtheshelf tools such as cobalt strike to attackers being able to purchase access to networks and the payloads they deploy to them this means that the impact of a successful ransomware and extortion attack remains the same regardless of the attackers skills raas is an arrangement between an operator and an affiliate the raas operator develops and maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations including the builders that produce the ransomware payloads and payment portals for communicating with victims the raas program may also include a leak site to share snippets of data exfiltrated from victims allowing attackers to show that the exfiltration is real and try to extort payment many raas programs further incorporate a suite of extortion support offerings including leak site hosting and integration into ransom notes as well as decryption negotiation payment pressure and cryptocurrency transaction services raas thus gives a unified appearance of the payload or campaign being a single ransomware family or set of attackers however what happens is that the raas operator sells access to the ransom payload and decryptor to an affiliate who performs the intrusion and privilege escalation and who is responsible for the deployment of the actual ransomware payload the parties then split the profit in addition raas developers and operators might also use the payload for profit sell it and run their campaigns with other ransomware payloadsfurther muddying the waters when it comes to tracking the criminals behind these actions figure how the raas affiliate model enables ransomware attacks a component of the cybercriminal economy is selling access to systems to other attackers for various purposes including ransomware access brokers can for instance infect systems with malware or a botnet and then sell them as a load a load is designed to install other malware or backdoors onto the infected systems for other criminals other access brokers scan the internet for vulnerable systems like exposed remote desktop protocol rdp systems with weak passwords or unpatched systems and then compromise them en masse to bank for later profit some advertisements for the sale of initial access specifically cite that a system isnt managed by an antivirus or endpoint detection and response edr product and has a highly privileged credential such as domain administrator associated with it to fetch higher prices most ransomware attackers opportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they get access to some attackers prioritize organizations with higher revenues while some target specific industries for the shock value or type of data they can exfiltrate for example attackers targeting hospitals or exfiltrating data from technology companies in many cases the targeting doesnt manifest itself as specifically attacking the targets network instead the purchase of access from an access broker or the use of existing malware infection to pivot to ransomware activities in some ransomware attacks the affiliates who bought a load or access may not even know or care how the system was compromised in the first place and are just using it as a jump server to perform other actions in a network access brokers often list the network details for the access they are selling but affiliates arent usually interested in the network itself but rather the monetization potential as a result some attacks that seem targeted to a specific industry might simply be a case of affiliates purchasing access based on the number of systems they could deploy ransomware to and the perceived potential for profit microsoft coined the term humanoperated ransomware to clearly define a class of attacks driven by expert human intelligence at every step of the attack chain and culminate in intentional business disruption and extortion humanoperated ransomware attacks share commonalities in the security misconfigurations of which they take advantage and the manual techniques used for lateral movement and persistence however the humanoperated nature of these actions means that variations in attacksincluding objectives and preransom activityevolve depending on the environment and the unique opportunities identified by the attackers these attacks involve many reconnaissance activities that enable human operators to profile the organization and know what next steps to take based on specific knowledge of the target many of the initial access campaigns that provide access to raas affiliates perform automated reconnaissance and exfiltration of information collected in the first few minutes of an attack after the attack shifts to a handsonkeyboard phase the reconnaissance and activities based on this knowledge can vary depending on the tools that come with the raas and the operators skill frequently attackers query for the currently running security tools privileged users and security settings such as those defined in group policy before continuing their attack the data discovered via this reconnaissance phase informs the attackers next steps if theres minimal security hardening to complicate the attack and a highly privileged account can be gained immediately attackers move directly to deploying ransomware by editing a group policy the attackers take note of security products in the environment and attempt to tamper with and disable these sometimes using scripts or tools provided with raas purchase that try to disable multiple security products at once other times using specific commands or techniques performed by the attacker this human decisionmaking early in the reconnaissance and intrusion stages means that even if a targets security solutions detect specific techniques of an attack the attackers may not get fully evicted from the network and can use other collected knowledge to attempt to continue the attack in ways that bypass security controls in many instances attackers test their attacks in production from an undetected location in their targets environment deploying tools or payloads like commodity malware if these tools or payloads are detected and blocked by an antivirus product the attackers simply grab a different tool modify their payload or tamper with the security products they encounter such detections could give socs a false sense of security that their existing solutions are working however these could merely serve as a smokescreen to allow the attackers to further tailor an attack chain that has a higher probability of success thus when the attack reaches the active attack stage of deleting backups or shadow copies the attack would be minutes away from ransomware deployment the adversary would likely have already performed harmful actions like the exfiltration of data this knowledge is key for socs responding to ransomware prioritizing investigation of alerts or detections of tools like cobalt strike and performing swift remediation actions and incident response ir procedures are critical for containing a human adversary before the ransomware deployment stage ransomware attackers often profit simply by disabling access to critical systems and causing system downtime although that simple technique often motivates victims to pay it is not the only way attackers can monetize their access to compromised networks exfiltration of data and double extortion which refers to attackers threatening to leak data if a ransom hasnt been paid has also become a common tactic among many raas affiliate programsmany of them offering a unified leak site for their affiliates attackers take advantage of common weaknesses to exfiltrate data and demand ransom without deploying a payload this trend means that focusing on protecting against ransomware payloads via security products or encryption or considering backups as the main defense against ransomware instead of comprehensive hardening leaves a network vulnerable to all the stages of a humanoperated ransomware attack that occur before ransomware deployment this exfiltration can take the form of using tools like rclone to sync to an external site setting up email transport rules or uploading files to cloud services with double extortion attackers dont need to deploy ransomware and cause downtime to extort money some attackers have moved beyond the need to deploy ransomware payloads and are shifting straight to extortion models or performing the destructive objectives of their attacks by directly deleting cloud resources one such extortion attackers is dev also known as lapsus which is profiled below paying the ransom may not reduce the risk to an affected network and potentially only serves to fund cybercriminals giving in to the attackers demands doesnt guarantee that attackers ever pack their bags and leave a network attackers are more determined to stay on a network once they gain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize attacks using different malware or ransomware payloads if they arent successfully evicted the handoff between different attackers as transitions in the cybercriminal economy occur means that multiple attackers may retain persistence in a compromised environment using an entirely different set of tools from those used in a ransomware attack for example initial access gained by a banking trojan leads to a cobalt strike deployment but the raas affiliate that purchased the access may choose to use a less detectable remote access tool such as teamviewer to maintain persistence on the network to operate their broader series of campaigns using legitimate tools and settings to persist versus malware implants such as cobalt strike is a popular technique among ransomware attackers to avoid detection and remain resident in a network for longer some of the common enterprise tools and techniques for persistence that microsoft has observed being used include anydesk atera remote management ngrokio remote manipulator system splashtop teamviewer another popular technique attackers perform once they attain privilege access is the creation of new backdoor user accounts whether local or in active directory these newly created accounts can then be added to remote access tools such as a virtual private network vpn or remote desktop granting remote access through accounts that appear legitimate on the network ransomware attackers have also been observed editing the settings on systems to enable remote desktop reduce the protocols security and add new users to the remote desktop users group the time between initial access to a handson keyboard deployment can vary wildly depending on the groups and their workloads or motivations some activity groups can access thousands of potential targets and work through these as their staffing allows prioritizing based on potential ransom payment over several months while some activity groups may have access to large and highly resourced companies they prefer to attack smaller companies for less overall ransom because they can execute the attack within hours or days in addition the return on investment is higher from companies that cant respond to a major incident ransoms of tens of millions of dollars receive much attention but take much longer to develop many groups prefer to ransom five to smaller targets in a month because the success rate at receiving payment is higher in these targets smaller organizations that cant afford an ir team are often more likely to pay tens of thousands of dollars in ransom than an organization worth millions of dollars because the latter has a developed ir capability and is likely to follow legal advice against paying in some instances a ransomware associate threat actor may have an implant on a network and never convert it to ransom activity in other cases initial access to full ransom including handoff from an access broker to a raas affiliate takes less than an hour figure humanoperated ransomware targeting and rate of success based on a sampling of microsoft data over six months between and the humandriven nature of these attacks and the scale of possible victims under control of ransomwareassociated threat actors underscores the need to take targeted proactive security measures to harden networks and prevent these attacks in their early stages for organizations to successfully respond to evict an active attacker its important to understand the active stage of an ongoing attack in the early attack stages such as deploying a banking trojan common remediation efforts like isolating a system and resetting exposed credentials may be sufficient as the attack progresses and the attacker performs reconnaissance activities and exfiltration its important to implement an incident response process that scopes the incident to address the impact specifically using a threat intelligencedriven methodology for understanding attacks can assist in determining incidents that need additional scoping in the next sections we provide a deep dive into the following prominent ransomware threat actors and their campaigns to increase community understanding of these attacks and enable organizations to better protect themselves dev cluster trickbot llc the most prolific ransomware group today elbrus unarrested development dev shifting payloads reflecting the rise and fall of raas programs dev prolific collaborator dev and dev distributing qakbot for ransomware deployment dev and dev an evil partnership dev chinabased lone wolf turned lockbit affiliate dev from extortion to destruction microsoft threat intelligence directly informs our products as part of our commitment to track adversaries and protect customers microsoft defender customers should prioritize alerts titled ransomwarelinked emerging threat activity group detected we also add the note ongoing handsonkeyboard attack to alerts that indicate a human attacker is in the network when these alerts are raised its highly recommended to initiate an incident response process to scope the attack isolate systems and regain control of credentials attackers may be in control of a note on threat actor naming as part of microsofts ongoing commitment to track both nationstate and cybercriminal threat actors we refer to the unidentified threat actors as a development group we use a naming structure with a prefix of dev to indicate an emerging threat group or unique activity during investigation when a nationstate group moves out of the dev stage we use chemical elements for example phosphorus and nobelium to name them on the other hand we use volcano names such as elbrus for ransomware or cybercriminal activity groups that have moved out of the dev state in the cybercriminal economy relationships between groups change very rapidly attackers are known to hire talent from other cybercriminal groups or use contractors who provide gig economystyle work on a limited time basis and may not rejoin the group this shifting nature means that many of the groups microsoft tracks are labeled as dev even if we have a concrete understanding of the nature of the activity group a vast amount of the current cybercriminal economy connects to a nexus of activity that microsoft tracks as dev also referred to as trickbot llc dev is responsible for developing distributing and managing many different payloads including trickbot bazaloader and anchordns in addition dev managed the ryuk raas program before the latters shutdown in june and ryuks successor conti as well as diavol microsoft has been tracking the activities of dev since october and has observed their expansion from developing and distributing the trickbot malware to becoming the most prolific ransomwareassociated cybercriminal activity group active today devs actions and use of the cybercriminal gig economy means they often add new members and projects and utilize contractors to perform various parts of their intrusions as other malware operations have shut down for various reasons including legal actions dev has hired developers from these groups most notable are the acquisitions of developers from emotet qakbot and icedid bringing them to the dev umbrella a subgroup of dev which microsoft tracks as dev provides infrastructure as a service for cybercriminals most notably dev provides cobalt strike beacon as a service these dev beacons have replaced unique c infrastructure in many active malware campaigns dev infrastructure has also been implicated in attacks deploying novel techniques including exploitation of cve the leaked chat files from a group publicly labeled as the conti group in february confirm the wide scale of dev activity tracked by microsoft based on our telemetry from and conti has become one of the most deployed raas ecosystems with multiple affiliates concurrently deploying their payloadeven as other raas ecosystems darksideblackmatter and revil ceased operations however payloadbased attribution meant that much of the activity that led to conti ransomware deployment was attributed to the conti group even though many affiliates had wildly different tradecraft skills and reporting structures some conti affiliates performed smallscale intrusions using the tools offered by the raas while others performed weekslong operations involving data exfiltration and extortion using their own techniques and tools one of the most prolific and successful conti affiliatesand the one responsible for developing the conti manual leaked in august is tracked as dev this activity group also developed and deployed the fivehands and hellokitty ransomware payloads and often gained access to an organization via devs bazaloader infrastructure microsoft hasnt observed a conti deployment in our data since april suggesting that the conti program has shut down or gone on hiatus potentially in response to the visibility of devs deployment of conti in highprofile incidents or fbis announcement of a reward for information related to conti as can be expected when a raas program shuts down the gig economy nature of the ransomware ecosystem means that affiliates can easily shift between payloads conti affiliates who had previously deployed conti have moved on to other raas payloads for example dev was deploying blackbasta parttime before the conti shutdown and is now deploying it regularly similarly dev shifted to deploying quantumlocker around april elbrus also known as fin has been known to be in operation since and has run multiple campaigns targeting a broad set of industries for financial gain elbrus has deployed pointofsale pos and atm malware to collect payment card information from instore checkout terminals they have also targeted corporate personnel who have access to sensitive financial data including individuals involved in sec filings in this activity group made headlines when three of its members were arrested in may another arrest was made for an individual with alleged involvement with elbrus however despite law enforcement actions against suspected individual members microsoft has observed sustained campaigns from the elbrus group itself during these periods elbrus is responsible for developing and distributing multiple custom malware families used for persistence including jssloader and griffon elbrus has also created fake security companies called combi security and bastion security to facilitate the recruitment of employees to their operations under the pretense of working as penetration testers in elbrus transitioned from using pos malware to deploying ransomware as part of a financially motivated extortion scheme specifically deploying the maze and revil raas families elbrus developed their own raas ecosystem named darkside they deployed darkside payloads as part of their operations and recruited and managed affiliates that deployed the darkside ransomware the tendency to report on ransomware incidents based on payload and attribute it to a monolithic gang often obfuscates the true relationship between the attackers which is very accurate of the darkside raas case in point one of the most infamous darkside deployments wasnt performed by elbrus but by a ransomware as a service affiliate microsoft tracks as dev elbrus retired the darkside ransomware ecosystem in may and released its successor blackmatter in july  replicating their patterns from darkside elbrus deployed blackmatter themselves and ran a raas program for affiliates the activity group then retired the blackmatter ransomware ecosystem in november while they arent currently publicly observed to be running a raas program elbrus is very active in compromising organizations via phishing campaigns that lead to their jssloader and griffon malware since elbrus has partnered with dev to distribute their malware implants dev acts as a distributor in the cybercriminal economy providing a service to distribute the payloads of other attackers through phishing and exploit kit vectors elbrus has also been abusing cve in exchange to compromise organizations in april of an interesting pivot to using a less popular authenticated vulnerability in the proxyshell cluster of vulnerabilities this abuse has allowed them to target organizations that patched only the unauthenticated vulnerability in their exchange server and turn compromised low privileged user credentials into highly privileged access as system on an exchange server an excellent example of how clustering activity based on ransomware payload alone can lead to obfuscating the threat actors behind the attack is dev dev has deployed at least six raas payloads since with many of their attacks becoming highprofile incidents attributed to the revil gang or blackcat ransomware group this attribution masks the actions of the set of the attackers in the dev umbrella including other revil and blackcat affiliates this has resulted in a confusing story of the scale of the ransomware problem and overinflated the impact that a single raas program shutdown can have on the threat environment figure ransomware payloads distributed by dev between and june dev shifts payloads when a raas program shuts down for example the deprecation of revil and blackmatter or possibly when a program with a better profit margin appears these market dynamics arent unique to dev and are reflected in most raas affiliates they can also manifest in even more extreme behavior where raas affiliates switch to older fully owned ransomware payloads like phobos which they can buy when a raas isnt available or they dont want to pay the fees associated with raas programs dev appears to rely on access brokers to enter a network using cobalt strike beacons they have possibly purchased access to once inside a network they rely heavily on psexec to move laterally and stage their payloads their techniques require them to have compromised elevated credentials and they frequently disable antivirus products that arent protected with tamper protection dev was responsible for deploying blackcat ransomware in companies in the energy sector in january around the same time dev also deployed blackcat in attacks against companies in the fashion tobacco it and manufacturing industries among others blackcat remains devs primary payload as of june like dev dev is a prolific raas affiliate that alternates between different payloads in their operations based on what is available dev heavily used ryuk and conti payloads from trickbot llcdev then hive payloads more recently many publicly documented ryuk and conti incidents and tradecraft can be traced back to dev after the activity group switched to hive as a payload a large uptick in hive incidents was observed their switch to the blackcat raas in march is suspected to be due to public discourse around hive decryption methodologies that is dev may have switched to blackcat because they didnt want hives decryptors to interrupt their business overlap in payloads has occurred as dev experiments with new raas programs on lowervalue targets they have been observed to experiment with some payloads only to abandon them later figure ransomware payloads distributed by dev between and june beyond raas payloads dev uses the cybercriminal gig economy to also gain initial access to networks devs proliferation and success rate come in part from their willingness to leverage the network intrusion work and malware implants of other groups versus performing their own initial compromise and malware development figure examples of devs relationships with other cybercriminal activity groups like all raas operators dev relies on compromised highly privileged account credentials and security weaknesses once inside a network dev often leverages cobalt strike beacon dropped by the malware they have purchased as well as tools like sharphound to conduct reconnaissance the group often utilizes bitsadmin transfer to stage their payloads an oftendocumented trademark of ryuk and conti deployments is naming the ransomware payload xxxexe a tradition that dev continues to use no matter what raas they are deploying as most recently observed with blackcat in late march of dev was observed to be using a new version of hive again in may dev started to routinely deploy nokoyawa a payload that we observed the group previously experimenting with when they werent using hive while the group used other payloads such as blackcat in the same timeframe nokoyawa became a more regular part of their toolkits by june dev was still primarily deploying hive and sometimes nokoyawa but was seen experimenting with other ransomware payloads including agenda and mindware dev is also one of several actors observed introducing other tools into their attacks to replace cobalt strike cobalt strikes ubiquity and visible impact has led to improved detections and heightened awareness in security organizations leading to observed decreased use by actors dev now uses the systembc rat and the penetration testing framework sliver in their attacks replacing cobalt strike the evolution of prevalent trojans from being commodity malware to serving as footholds for ransomware is well documented via the impact of emotet trickbot and bazaloader another widely distributed malware qakbot also leads to handoffs to raas affiliates qakbot is delivered via email often downloaded by malicious macros in an office document qakbots initial actions include profiling the system and the network and exfiltrating emails eml files for later use as templates in its malware distribution campaigns qakbot is prevalent across a wide range of networks building upon successful infections to continue spreading and expanding microsoft tracks dev and dev as  qakbot distributors that result in observed ransomware attacks dev distributes the presidentsthemed qakbot using american presidents names in their malware campaigns meanwhile dev distributes the tr qakbot and other malware such as squirrelwaffle dev also rapidly adopted the microsoft support diagnostic tool msdt vulnerability cve in their campaigns the abuse of malicious macros and msdt can be blocked by preventing office from creating child processes which we detail in the hardening guidance below historically qakbot infections typically lead to handsonkeyboard activity and ransomware deployments by dev dev and dev dev previously deployed conti but switched to deploying black basta around april this group uses devs cobalt strike beacon infrastructure instead of maintaining their own in late september microsoft observed dev adding brute ratel as a tool to facilitate their handsonkeyboard access as well as cobalt strike beacons another raas affiliate that acquired access from qakbot infections was dev which maintains their own cobalt strike beacon infrastructure and has operated as an affiliate for egregor maze lockbit revil and conti in numerous highimpact incidents microsoft no longer sees dev ransomware incidents initiating from dev and dev infections indicating they may no longer be acquiring access via qakbot malvertising which refers to taking out a search engine ad to lead to a malware payload has been used in many campaigns but the access broker that microsoft tracks as dev uses this as their primary technique to gain access to and profile networks targets are lured by an ad purporting to be a browser update or a software package to download a zip file and doubleclick it the zip package contains a javascript file js which in most environments runs when doubleclicked organizations that have changed the settings such that script files open with a text editor by default instead of a script handler are largely immune from this threat even if a user double clicks the script once successfully executed the javascript framework also referred to socgholish acts as a loader for other malware campaigns that use access purchased from dev most commonly cobalt strike payloads these payloads have in numerous instances led to custom cobalt strike loaders attributed to dev dev falls under activities tracked by the cyber intelligence industry as evilcorp  the custom cobalt strike loaders are similar to those seen in publicly documented blister malwares inner payloads in devs initial partnerships with dev the group deployed a custom ransomware payload known as wastedlocker and then expanded to additional dev ransomware payloads developed inhouse such as phoenixlocker and macaw around november dev started to deploy the lockbit raas payload in their intrusions the use of a raas payload by the evilcorp activity group is likely an attempt by dev to avoid attribution to their group which could discourage payment due to their sanctioned status figure the handover from dev to dev on july microsoft researchers discovered the fakeupdates malware being delivered via existing raspberry robin infections raspberry robin is a usbbased worm first publicly discussed by red canary the devassociated fakeupdates activity on affected systems has since led to followon actions resembling dev preransomware behavior differing from the other raas developers affiliates and access brokers profiled here dev appears to be an activity group involved in all stages of their attack lifecycle from initial access to ransomware development despite this they seem to take some inspiration from successful raas operations with the frequent rebranding of their ransomware payloads unique among humanoperated ransomware threat actors tracked by microsoft dev is confirmed to be a chinabased activity group dev differs from many of the attackers who rely on purchasing access to existing malware implants or exposed rdp to enter a network instead the group heavily utilizes unpatched vulnerabilities to access networks including vulnerabilities in exchange manage engine adselfservice plus confluence and logj due to the nature of the vulnerabilities they preferred dev gains elevated credentials at the initial access stage of their attack once inside a network dev relies on standard techniques such as using cobalt strike and wmi for lateral movement but they have some unique preferences for implementing these behaviors their cobalt strike beacons are frequently launched via dll search order hijacking while they use the common impacket tool for wmi lateral movement they use a customized version of the wmiexecpy module of the tool that creates renamed output files most likely to evade static detections ransomware deployment is ultimately performed from a batch file in a share and group policy usually written to the netlogon share on a domain controller which requires the attackers to have obtained highly privileged credentials like domain administrator to perform this action figure ransomware payloads distributed by dev between and april because dev maintains and frequently rebrands their own ransomware payloads they can appear as different groups in payloaddriven reporting and evade detections and actions against them their payloads are sometimes rebuilt from existing forpurchase ransomware tools like rook which shares code similarity with the babuk ransomware family in february of dev was observed deploying the pandora ransomware family primarily via unpatched vmware horizon systems vulnerable to the logj cve vulnerability like many raas operators dev maintained a leak site to post exfiltrated data and motivate victims to pay however their frequent rebranding caused these systems to sometimes be unready for their victims with their leak site sometimes leading to default web server landing pages when victims attempt to pay  in a notable shiftpossibly related to victim payment issuesdev started deploying lockbit ransomware payloads in april around june it began replacing cobalt strike with the sliver framework in their attacks an example of a threat actor who has moved to a pure extortion and destruction model without deploying ransomware payloads is an activity group that microsoft tracks as dev also known as lapsus microsoft has detailed dev actions taken in early in this blog dev started targeting organizations mainly in latin america but expanded to global targeting including government entities technology telecom retailers and healthcare unlike more opportunistic attackers dev targets specific companies with an intent their initial access techniques include exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in internetfacing systems searching public code repositories for credentials and taking advantage of weak passwords in addition there is evidence that dev leverages credentials stolen by the redline password stealer a piece of malware available for purchase in the cybercriminal economy the group also buys credentials from underground forums which were gathered by other passwordstealing malware once initial access to a network is gained dev takes advantage of security misconfigurations to elevate privileges and move laterally to meet their objectives of data exfiltration and extortion while dev doesnt possess any unique technical capabilities the group is especially cloudaware they target cloud administrator accounts to set up forwarding rules for email exfiltration and tamper with administrative settings on cloud environments as part of their goals to force payment of ransom dev attempts to delete all server infrastructure and data to cause business disruption to further facilitate the achievement of their goals they remove legitimate admins and delete cloud resources and server infrastructure resulting in destructive attacks dev also takes advantage of cloud admin privileges to monitor email chats and voip communications to track incident response efforts to their intrusions dev has been observed on multiple occasions to join incident response calls not just observing the response to inform their attack but unmuting to demand ransom and sharing their screens while they delete their victims data and resources a durable security strategy against determined human adversaries must include the goal of mitigating classes of attacks and detecting them ransomware attacks generate multiple disparate security product alerts but they could easily get lost or not responded to in time alert fatigue is real and socs can make their lives easier by looking at trends in their alerts or grouping alerts into incidents so they can see the bigger picture socs can then mitigate alerts using hardening capabilities like attack surface reduction rules hardening against common threats can reduce alert volume and stop many attackers before they get access to networks attackers tweak their techniques and have tools to evade and disable security products they are also wellversed in system administration and try to blend in as much as possible however while attacks have continued steadily and with increased impact the attack techniques attackers use havent changed much over the years therefore a renewed focus on prevention is needed to curb the tide ransomware attackers are motivated by easy profits so adding to their cost via security hardening is key in disrupting the cybercriminal economy more than malware attackers need credentials to succeed in their attacks in almost all attacks where ransomware deployment was successful the attackers had access to a domain adminlevel account or local administrator passwords that were consistent throughout the environment deployment then can be done through group policy or tools like psexec or clones like paexec csexec and winexesvc without the credentials to provide administrative access in a network spreading ransomware to multiple systems is a bigger challenge for attackers compromised credentials are so important to these attacks that when cybercriminals sell illgotten access to a network in many instances the price includes a guaranteed administrator account to start with credential theft is a common attack pattern many administrators know tools like mimikatz and lazagne and their capabilities to steal passwords from interactive logons in the lsass process detections exist for these tools accessing the lsass process in most security products however the risk of credential exposure isnt just limited to a domain administrator logging in interactively to a workstation because attackers have accessed and explored many networks during their attacks they have a deep knowledge of common network configurations and use it to their advantage one common misconfiguration they exploit is running services and scheduled tasks as highly privileged service accounts too often a legacy configuration ensures that a missioncritical application works by giving the utmost permissions possible many organizations struggle to fix this issue even if they know about it because they fear they might break applications this configuration is especially dangerous as it leaves highly privileged credentials exposed in the lsa secrets portion of the registry which users with administrative access can access in organizations where the local administrator rights havent been removed from end users attackers can be one hop away from domain admin just from an initial attack like a banking trojan building credential hygiene is developing a logical segmentation of the network based on privileges that can be implemented alongside network segmentation to limit lateral movement here are some steps organizations can take to build credential hygiene aim to run services as local system when administrative privileges are needed as this allows applications to have high privileges locally but cant be used to move laterally run services as network service when accessing other resources use tools like lua buglight to determine the privileges that applications really need look for events with eventid where the logon type is or and the account is highly privileged like a domain admin this helps admins understand which credentials are vulnerable to theft via lsass or lsa secrets ideally any highly privileged account like a domain admin shouldnt be exposed on member servers or workstations monitor for eventid logon failed events in windows event forwarding when removing accounts from privileged groups adding them to the local administrator group on a limited set of machines to keep an application running still reduces the scope of an attack as against running them as domain admin randomize local administrator passwords with a tool like local administrator password s olution laps to prevent lateral movement using local accounts with shared passwords use a cloudbased identity security solution that leverages onpremises active directory signals get visibility into identity configurations and to identify and detect threats or compromised identities auditing credential exposure is critical in preventing ransomware attacks and cybercrime in general bloodhound is a tool that was originally designed to provide network defenders with insight into the number of administrators in their environment it can also be a powerful tool in reducing privileges tied to administrative account and understanding your credential exposure it security teams and socs can work together with the authorized use of this tool to enable the reduction of exposed credentials any teams deploying bloodhound should monitor it carefully for malicious use they can also use this detection guidance to watch for malicious use microsoft has observed ransomware attackers also using bloodhound in attacks when used maliciously bloodhound allows attackers to see the path of least resistance from the systems they have access to highly privileged accounts like domain admin accounts and global administrator accounts in azure security patches for active directory should be applied as soon as possible after they are released microsoft has witnessed ransomware attackers adopting authentication vulnerabilities within one hour of being made public and as soon as those vulnerabilities are included in tools like mimikatz ransomware activity groups also rapidly adopt vulnerabilities related to authentication such as zerologon and petitpotam especially when they are included in toolkits like mimikatz when unpatched these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to rapidly escalate from an entrance vector like email to domain admin level privileges as attackers move towards cloud resources its important to secure cloud resources and identities as well as onpremises accounts here are ways organizations can harden cloud environments cloud identity hardening implement the azure security benchmark and general best practices for securing identity infrastructure including prevent onpremises service accounts from having direct rights to the cloud resources to prevent lateral movement to the cloud ensure that break glass account passwords are stored offline and configure honeytoken activity for account usage implement conditional access policies enforcing microsofts zero trust principles enable riskbased user signin protection and automate threat response to block highrisk signins from all locations and enable mfa for mediumrisk ones ensure that vpn access is protected via modern authentication methods multifactor authentication mfa enforce mfa on all accounts remove users excluded from mfa and strictly r equire mfa from all devices in all locations at all times enable passwordless authentication methods for example windows hello fido keys or microsoft authenticator for accounts that support passwordless for accounts that still require passwords use authenticator apps like microsoft authenticator for mfa refer to this article for the different authentication methods and features identify and secure workload identities to secure accounts where traditional mfa enforcement does not apply ensure that users are properly educated on not accepting unexpected twofactor authentication fa for mfa that uses authenticator apps ensure that the app requires a code to be typed in where possible as many intrusions where mfa was enabled including those by dev still succeeded due to users clicking yes on the prompt on their phones even when they were not at their computers refer to this article for an example disable legacy authentication cloud admins ensure cloud adminstenant admins are treated with the same level of security and credential hygiene as domain admins address gaps in authentication coverage in almost every observed ransomware incident at least one system involved in the attack had a misconfigured security product that allowed the attacker to disable protections or evade detection in many instances the initial access for access brokers is a legacy system that isnt protected by  antivirus or edr solutions its important to understand that the lack security controls on these systems that have access to highly privileged credentials act as blind spots that allow attackers to perform the entire ransomware and exfiltration attack chain from a single system without being detected in some instances this is specifically advertised as a feature that access brokers sell organizations should review and verify that security tools are running in their most secure configuration and perform regular network scans to ensure appropriate security products are monitoring and protecting all systems including servers if this isnt possible make sure that your legacy systems are either physically isolated through a firewall or logically isolated by ensuring they have no credential overlap with other systems for microsoft defender customers the following checklist eliminates security blind spots turn on clouddelivered protection in microsoft defender antivirus to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques block new and unknown malware variants and enhance attack surface reduction rules and tamper protection turn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security services run edr in block mode so that microsoft defender for endpoint can block malicious artifacts even when a nonmicrosoft antivirus doesnt detect the threat or when microsoft defender antivirus is running in passive mode edr in block mode also blocks indicators identified proactively by microsoft threat intelligence teams enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other malicious content on the internet enable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow microsoft defender for endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches use device discovery to increase visibility into the network by finding unmanaged devices and onboarding them to microsoft defender for endpoint protect user identities and credentials using microsoft defender for identity a cloudbased security solution that leverages onpremises active directory signals to monitor and analyze user behavior to identify suspicious user activities configuration issues and active attacks microsoft defender customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent common attack techniques used in ransomware attacks these rules which can be configured by all microsoft defender antivirus customers and not just those using the edr solution offer significant hardening against attacks in observed attacks from several ransomwareassociated activity groups microsoft customers who had the following rules enabled were able to mitigate the attack in the initial stages and prevented handsonkeyboard activity common entry vectors block all office applications from creating child processes block office communication application from creating child processes block office applications from creating executable content block office applications from injecting code into other processes block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts block javascript or vbscript from launching downloaded executable content ransomware deployment and lateral movement stage in order of impact based on the stage in attack they prevent block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence age or trusted list criterion block credential stealing from the windows local security authority subsystem lsassexe block process creations originating from psexec and wmi commands use advanced protection against ransomware in addition microsoft has changed the default behavior of office applications to block macros in files from the internet further reduce the attack surface for many humanoperated ransomware attacks and other threats organizations must identify and secure perimeter systems that attackers might use to access the network public scanning interfaces such as riskiq can be used to augment data some systems that should be considered of interest to attackers and therefore need to be hardened include secure remote desktop protocol rdp or windows virtual desktop endpoints with mfa to harden against password spray or brute force attacks block remote it management tools such as teamviewer splashtop remote manipulator system anydesk atera remote management and ngrokio via network blocking such as perimeter firewall rules if not in use in your environment if these systems are used in your environment enforce security settings where possible to implement mfa ransomware attackers and access brokers also use unpatched vulnerabilities whether already disclosed or zeroday especially in the initial access stage even older vulnerabilities were implicated in ransomware incidents in because some systems remained unpatched partially patched or because access brokers had established persistence on a previously compromised systems despite it later being patched some observed vulnerabilities used in campaigns between and that defenders can check for and mitigate include citrix adc systems affected

manageengine systems affected by cve fortigate vpn servers affected by cve apache logj cve ransomware attackers also rapidly adopt new vulnerabilities to further reduce organizational exposure microsoft defender for endpoint customers can use the threat and vulnerability management capability to discover prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations the multifaceted threat

partenaires actualités blog newsletters contact par admin sec jan bulletin danalyse alphv or blackcat or noberus ransomware emerged only last december and is already considered as a genuine threat that blue teams should be ready to fight against while little is known on the employed entry vectors this conjecture relies not only on the high level of developing skills required to build such peculiar ransomware payloads and dedicated leak sites but also more resilient and secure architecture the number of highprofile victims is already growing at a fast pace and could keep switching between big and mid game hunting in the coming monthsyears moreover though not yet proven alphv intends to embrace a triple extortion scheme by launching ddos towards victims assets if the ransom is not paid as far as the threat genealogy is concerned darkweb forum analysis allows us to conjecture that at least one actor affiliate andor operator andor web developer with recent or past ties to darksideblackmatterrevil decided to jump into a new raas program referred to as alphv in addition we found that another actor could have been somewhat involved in the lockbit andor the alphv raas program after pivoting from its avatar we found with medium high confidence that the ransomware brand was inspired by a cult russian movie where the black cat gang leaves a cat drawing or an actual cat at the scene of the crime last but not least we found a running tool being leveraged by affiliates of alphv to download and run payloads upon an attack from a remote server which possesses strong code overlap with the lockbits running tool at the end of the document we provide actionable intelligence to strengthen relevant layers of defences seeking to reduce or preempt the impact of this emerging threat intrusion set descriptionchronology aliases primary motivation goals targets identify location or vulnerability attributiongenealogy analysis frontend and backend analysis of dls

dedicated to its affiliates published on the public dls of alphv domain analysis of the alphvs infrastructure to the best of our knowledge the first attack that deployed alphv raas was reported by symantec three variants in total hit hundreds of machines on november while the first suspicious network activity had been observed on november the group is referred to as alphv and is also known as blackcat because of a black cat icon set by the group in the first version of their dedicated leak site or noberus by symantec financial gains alphv aims at stealing confidential information encrypting files and then demanding a ransom that needs to be paid otherwise threat actors publish the collected information or sell it to interested third parties the array below presents known victims hit by alphv ransomware please note that it is usually an underestimated list upon our analysis we already found some probable victims that remained under the scope of the cybersecurity community so far from the limited amount of data available one can highlight that as it is commonly observed the most targeted countries are primarily american and then european another common trait

glance contradictory as on one hand according to recorded future experts the operator of alphv had been previously a member of the wellknown ransomware group revil while on the other hand according to the official lockbit support account on the russian cybercrime forum xss the alphv is a rebranding of darkside blackmatter ransomware brands see figure figure screenshot of a post by the official lockbit support nd most impactful ransomware gang claiming that alphv operator was a former member of darkside blackmatter ransomware brands alphv operator was also seen replying to a troll feed on xss forum targeting lockbit see figure which could indicate that they are competitors alphv owns a businessoriented premium account that costs about one hundred dollars per year which shows the intention of the latter to weight into the raas landscape figure on the left a screenshot taken on december from a random channel of the russian cybercrime forum xss alphv operator replied to the trolling post of another user named kelegen on the right claiming that the lockbit dedicated leak site was pwned the premium account alphv was created on december and has posted so far only this short message an analysis from korean threat intelligence sw lab company pinpointed that like other raas ransomgangs a config file is leveraged as an input to endow the ransomware with custom features tailored for the victims see analysis for details of note is the strong overlap with the config file previously used by blackmatter from the timeline provided by sw though they conclude that it would have been too soon for alphv to rebrand from blackmatter while rewriting from scratch a dls dedicated leak site and a rust based ransomware this could substantiate at the first glance an attribution to the revil ransom cartel whom first shutdown occurred in july and then was hacked and forced offline after a comeback since the end of october this year but there is too little material at the time of writing to conclude as far as blackmatter is concerned however technical evidences such as the encryption routine study and code similarities show that blackmatter signed the comeback of darkside core teams this revival took place at the moment of darkside s disappearance following its infamous colonial pipeline major attack we shall then recall the genesis of darkside which was born in august when pentesters first rent revil raas operated by pinchy spider until carbon spider operated its own variant based on the code of revil that became darkside to conclude on that first part we thus underline past ties between revil and darkside as well as more recently between darkside and blackmatter as far as the ransomware code is concerned we shall underline that blackmatter is a mashup between lockbit darkside and revil a possible scenario would be that at least one actor affiliate andor operator andor web developer with recent or past ties to darksideblackmatterrevil decided to jump into a new raas program referred to as alphv but this assumption remains speculative at this stage from another interesting conversation on the ramp forum about the withdrawal of blackmatter and assumptions on their next move an avatar named blackcat also arouse our interest see figure indeed it turns out that the latter participated in the past not only in a similar conversation on the russian cybercrime xss forum with the same account name but also in other topics involving the lockbitsupp account figure screenshot taken from russian cybercrime xss forum displaying that lockbit claims to know the operator of alphv a former member of the infamous revil group and that blackcat liked this assumption its avatar on xss and exploit both major russianspeaking cybercrime forums represent a picture of the famous russian revolutionary lenin taken in gorki where he spent the last year of his life this could show that the latter has a particular interest in blackmatter and a kind of friendship with the lockbit operator at the very least a crossanalysis of its avatar content shows a particular tropism for raas programs in addition to that the most recent avatar on ramp of blackcat is an angry cat which obviously reminds the free black cat icon that was chosen by alphv for private onion negotiation sites also angry by reverse image search analysis we found its ramp avatar on an entertainment website illustrating a cult film upon the former soviet union called the meeting place cannot be changed  the plot synopsis is not without remembering what could experience members of raas programs in which a gang of armed robbers calling itself  the black cat keeps evading capture even more striking is the bleeding knife website icon used for the crime investigation category that turns out to be the very same used on the public dls of alphv see figure we retrieved the link between those two observed website icons by alphv on their private and public dls figure on the left the profile of blackcat on ramp forum on the right an illustration obtained by reverse image analysis of the blackcat avatar on ramp forum linked to a cult russian movie where the black cat gang leaves a cat drawing or an actual cat at the scene of the crime the knife icon of the website used for the crime investigation category matches the one used by alphv on their public dls based on topics and conversations in which blackcat is involved we think that his profile could fit the one of an affiliate being involved in raas program with pentesting skills more interesting is that the latter requested help to protect against ddos attacks on the aforementioned russian cybercrime forum known as exploit with the same lenin avatar picture and account name blackcat than was observed on xss this recalls the fact that alphv named and shamed lockbit which recently suffered ddos attacks right after the latter defrayed the chronicle by leaking very sensitive data of accenture on their centralized dls reachable by a unique onion domain it is assumed that the hack back was triggered by victims third parties assisting with incident response andor us agencies according to lockbit operator as a result one could conjecture that blackcat could have been somewhat involved into the lockbit raas program andor the alphv one to avoid being hacked back by ddos attacks sw lab also showed that the frontend developing was carried out in three stages first a private leak site was used now down that became a unique public dedicated leak site dls while negotiation site are unique per victim for this a uuid is generated via the command cmd c wmic csproduct get uuid this command is used to generate an access key being required to reach the correct url following this scheme hxxpavtoruniquehiddenwebaddressonionaccesskeyaccess_key  as far as the public leak site of alphv is concerned its technology relies for the frontend on angular which enhances users experience with single page applications this extensively used open source framework is coupled to zonejs to reduce ui refreshing when change detection occurs from our experience this web technology is not often encountered and translates good skills in terms of web developing the web developer could be a dedicated person and not necessarily the operator maintaining in operational conditions the infrastructure as a result an automated survey of their public dedicated leak site dls by cti teams is more difficult fortunately we found a workaround to provide information on victims that can be ingested in an automated way content available in the private release concerning the backend this group claims to have learned from other ransomcartels mistakes such as conti which recently saw their servers uncovered by the prodaft threat intel team also peculiar is the generation of a unique onion domain per each new company hit by alphv ransomware this change of modus operandi was most likely driven by the intention to reduce the impact of the aforementioned ddos attack alphv offer an intricate affiliate program see appendix with selfdeletion scripts a builtin bitcoin mixer integrated which does not communicate with the alphv infrastructure backend the latter is fragmented into nodes that are interconnected through a whole network of pads within the onion network being behind a network address translation nat so genuine ip addresses are not directly accessible from the internet and are protected by a firewall since early december the operator of alphv has been promoting its raas program on the underground russian forums ramp see an english translation in appendix inviting other criminals to join ransomware attacks against large companies the operator mentioned later that only russian speaking affiliate could join the program either by payment or by skill it is worth mentioning though that overall more and more chinese translations are found on underground forums in a sort of an objective alliance between countries of commonwealth of independent states and china black hats against western countries the operator claims that the malware can encrypt data on systems running windows linux and vmware esxi and partners will receive to of the final ransom depending on the total amount received from the victims figure alphv operator named ransom joined the ramp forum the th december and depicted the day after its raas affiliate program ramp is a russianspeaking underground forum that was launched in july the operator of ramp was linked to the operator of babuk and payloadbin nb we translated this page into english alphv operators were also seen on another underground russian forum known as exploit see figure where they were actively recruiting pentesters specialized in windowslinux and esxi in the same post they shared two tox addresses and a jabber address to discuss in a secure environment figure screenshot taken from the exploit underground forum showing the active recruiting process engaged by alphv to collaborate with pentesters specialized in windowslinux and esxi they shared two tox addresses and a jabber to discuss in a secure environment focusing now on the ransomware anatomy the latter encrypts selected files throughout a whitelist and adds custom extensions to infected files length extension such as sykffle was so far witnessed in the wild for this program and most of the time chosen randomly a peculiar trait of this ransomware upon deployment is its ability throughout commandline to apply numerous options reachable via help available features are presented for windows and linux systems respectively in figure and figure figure features provided by a representative sample of an alphv ransomware sample targeting windows systems figure features provided by a representative sample of an alphv ransomware sample targeting linux systems every sample can be customized via an embedded json configuration file as shown by bleeping computer that enables common features such as creating a unique access token is a previously seen antianalysis tactic used by similar threats such as for the victim to keep negotiations for private changing extensions ransom notes data encryption exclusions of foldersfilesextensions and the services and processes to be automatically killed to crank up the impact supplying an access token as a parameter is previously seen antianalysis tactic such as threats like egregor figure screenshot of a representative sample of the config file extracted from a windows alphv ransomware strain admin credentials and the victims name could be stored and could leak upon negotiations to the public even before being exposed on alphvs dls if a payload is pushed towards a thirdparty platform several features that can be enabled or disabled make this ransomware very versatile and impactful in particular the capability of esxi vm and snapshot kill we could extract and analyse several outputs of both linux and windows samples and confirm the conclusions of sw see figure of important note is that every successful attack stores admin credentials and the victims name into specific fields of the config file that could become public once payloads are submitted to thirdparty platforms such as virustotal please see an obfuscated example displayed via an opensource script every compiled sample analysed so far would have been compiled via the emerging rust language instead of a more commonly encountered cc language rust is a multiparadigm programming language developed by mozilla in as a matter of fact it is the third impactful malware written in rust language and the first of a kind as a ransomwareasaservice such a peculiar choice was probably made not only because rust is a crossplatform language windows linux osx but also to better evade existing detection capabilities and reverse engineering methods moreover when compared with cc programming language as rust applies stricter rules the latter could be considered more secure by default in the eyes of a programmer alternatively the golang programming language keeps growing fast and is also an opensource project with crossplatform capabilities the latter was already used for instance by hive or nephilim raas programs to take advantage of the languages concurrency features to encrypt files faster however its ties with google might restrain some operators of ransomwares as googles projects in overall do not fit the political vision they want to display to the public there are four types of encryption options as described by bleepingcomputer ie full fast dotpattern and auto all samples of alphv use a combination of aesctr and rsa encryption to secure their malware against the researchers getting encrypted files back amongst the several modes that aes operates with mostly used is cbc cipher block chaining while ctr counter was witnessed in the past by a few threats such as lockergoga nefilim and revil in the case where advanced encryption standard aes is not supported by the os and if auto mode option is enabled chacha encryption is applied instead so far no weaknesses were found and over all such new raas program is considered by the cybersecurity to be very sophisticated alphv also mentions that in contrast to what happened to revil after the massive kaseya attack a leak of a universal decryptor is not possible diving into reverse engineering code analysis of alphv ransomware targeting windows systems we discuss key functions leveraged by the ransomware and any commonalities found with past known techniques enumservicesstatusexw is usually used by ransomwares for enumerating all the active services with the aim to delete services matching a list present in the config file of alphv the call of such function was for instance already seen in the wild in the darkside blackmatter revil and netwalker netserverenum is used to list all servers of the specified type that are visible in a domain the latterwas was seen previously also being leveraged by regretlocker wannacry notpetya and trickbot operated by wizard spider as a wormlike malware propagation module to spread over server message block smb netshareenum playing the role of discovering network shares to enumerate dns hostnames on the network was encountered within numerous ransomwares such as ranzy locker netwalker cuba lockbit blackmatter and conti operated by wizard spider enumdependentservicesw was found to be shared with avaddon lockergoga to retrieve the name and status of each service that depends on specified services arp scanner via the command arp a t scans the targeted devices address resolution protocol arp table which stores information about ip addresses and the corresponding mac address the discovery of new networks allows then to fully scan for smb volumes that can be mounted and eventually encrypted to crank up the impact such arp scanner was previously seen embedded within strains of darkside lockbit ranzy locker avaddon dopplepaymer we can also underline variants of ryuk and conti that exhibited more sophisticated behaviours by taking advantage of arp the former reads arp tables and wake systems up by sending wakeonlan commands then use rpc to copy itself to identified network shares while the latter retrieves the arp cache to focus only on network shares to which the victims normally connects to to be noted beyond ryuk wakeonlan peculiar feature is that other raas programs borrowed that capability such as lockbit or thanos figure command line tool called arp available on linux macos and windows was found in the source code of alphv ransomware to be used as an arp scanner feature the scanner allows to look for details about the network configuration t we are discussing the approach to gather indicators of compromise iocs and define the infrastructure and ttps leveraged by affiliates of the alphv raas program and its operator besides from tlp white indicators of compromise shared by the platform malware bazaar samples were available we could pivot on vt intel to harvest other reported and related iocs see the recommendation section for technical details by pivoting on one of the elf linux variant samples a lower sized file named setupexe see details in vt here that contrasted with the other ransomware payloads has drawn our attention as no guid identifier has been found in this file we sought to pivot around artefacts unique strings into content file as such we could find two other similar files reported into virustotal see figure figure screenshot of virustotal intelligence platform after pivoting on a unique string found into portable executable content the size of the files are very close while the second one turns out to be linked to another infamous ransomware group dubbed lockbit those files are net modules and not with a pe more standard format file we analysed more thoroughly the file by reverse engineering the latter via the opensource tool dnspy we first want to point out that no obfuscation is at play thus all code can be directly rationalized four main functions stood out as shown in figure after reversing the runner used by alphv affiliates it is interesting to note that download and upload functions point to the ip address the latter resolves the host from which was also present the runner setupexe meaning that ransomware payloads were hosted at the same place we found out about the same time that malwrhunterteam substantiated this result in one of their tweet once the runner is launched with an accesstoken set as an input a messagebox like the one shown in figure pops up and asks the user whether or not really run locker if the user chooses yes an alphv ransomware payload will be downloaded from the remote host and executed locally figure screenshot of the runner setupexe found to be tight to the alphv threat arsenal four main functions are at play downloadandrun fullinfo start uploadddedinfo and uploadfiles both the runner and the payloads are hosted at hxxpfiles after investigations via vt intelligence we found that the second hash shown in figure was detected by some antivirus as lockbit ransomware we thus decided to pursue the research in that direction and pivot around that ioc after having unravelled the infrastructure behind that ioc one can observe in figure that i the occurrence lockbit is often used in namings ii the runnerexe setupexe possesses numerous variants iii urls follow the same pattern observed for alphv ie httpip_addressfilestoolnameexe and iv the payload name mmcexe was also used by alphv see here an example we checked that the payloads do indeed correspond to lockbit weaponized strains moreover we found that the hash value of the tool referred to as screensaverexe was reported by the dfir report back in june upon an attack by lockbit ransomware in which an executable that allows to lock out access to the desktop was dropped but was not used figure screenshot taken from virustotal intelligence platform after having pivoted around the second hash highlighted in figure see blue colour one can observe several iocs that belong to the infamous lockbit ransomware as well as some of its toolset namely a screensaver locker and a runner for downloading payloads for encryption that is similar to the one that alphv used as we found no direct link of this infrastructure with recent attacks perpetrated by lockbit affiliates the latter could also have been used as a test infrastructure by alphv this is substantiated by the filename lockbit_gayexe see figure submitted the vt on which could indicate that an imposter essentially rebranded the tool used by lockbit affiliates and used it for alphvs campaigns the word gay is not without recalling the recent flooded babuks new ransomware forum ramp crippled by a comment spammer with gay orgy porn gifs not only the filenames setupexe their size in a range of kb but also the source code is obviously strongly overlapping as demonstrated in figure  the main change arises from the adaptation of the code with the aim to include the antianalysis tactic required for running a payload of alphv ie the aforementioned unique accesstoken figure source code differencing via git diff reverse engineering analysis shows that the source code of the lockbits arsenal in red and the alphvs arsenal in green are strongly overlapping the main change arises from the adaptation of the code to include the unique accesstoken per victim required for running a payload of alphv it is hard to conclude at this stage to conclude whether or not alphv is a new group or not however it suggests that alphv at the very least borrowed a part of the lockbit s toolset which requires nonpublic knowledge such knowledge of leveraging a runner for downloading and running ransomwares from remote servers could have been likely shared by affiliates that participle sometimes to several ransomwareasaservice program it could also be a subgroup of lockbit that split because of internal frictions or a rebrand triggered by the coregroup of lockbit to take their ransomware to the next generation and escape sanctions alphv here is a json file format compatible with the mitre attck navigator of shared ttps of both representative payloads targeting linux windows systems as well as the operator and affiliates modus operandi reported so far it is interesting to note that by pivoting on their public dls we found a section dedicated to alphv affiliates that provides a procedure on how to leverage the ransomware payloads on different operating systems upon an attack see appendix tactic technique procedure execution ta system services  service execution t command and scripting interpreter windows command shell t windows management instrumentation t shared modules t in some cases ransomware was deployed via screenconnect but also via psexec being embedded in the ransomware code after a compression via zlib alphv uses significantly the remote administration tool psexec t as well as the powershell language t alphv can use the windows command line to delete volume shadow copies and disable recovery modify window registry the adversary uses wmi to execute various behaviours such as gathering information for discovery fsutil was executed to modify the symlink evaluation behaviour to change the type of symbolic links that can be created on the system symbolic links create a file in a directory that acts as a shortcut to another file or folder credential access ta adversaryinthemiddle llmnrnbtns poisoning and smb relay t os credential dumping lsa secrets t symantec has reported suspicious server message block smb

adversaryinthemiddle llmnrnbtns poisoning and smb relay t threat actors may have leveraged llmnrnbtns poisoning and smb relay subtechnique defense evasion ta impair defenses disable or modify tools t signed binary proxy execution cmstp t modify registry t according to symantec the attackers disabled a restricted remote administration feature known as restrictedadmin mode but also windows defender wellknown technique to circumvent windows user account control uac see details in appendix modification of the registry occurred upon an attack according to symantec attackers were also seen to tweak the maximum limit of concurrent requests machines by modifying the windows registry to further help spreading via psexec please note that we found that this is actually a capacity of the ransomware itself and not a humanoperated command see appendix discovery ta system information discovery t system network connections discovery t ingress tool transfer t alphv runs commands to collect system information via wmic in order to collect universally unique identifiers uuids from each machine these are then used to generate the access token that makes up part of the unique tor address victims are instructed to visit alphv attempts to propagate via mounting hidden partitions thanks to the net use command as aforementioned admin credentials are embedded into the config file within the payload alphv affiliates bring their own external tools into a compromised network exfiltration ta exfiltration over web service t double extortion exposure of sensitive data on a dls alphv leaks victim data not only if the victims do not pay but also once threat intel teams accesses their chat logs or discusses their operations this posture recalls recent threats proclaimed by several raas groups as chat logs were leaked and exposed by cti teams and renowned cybersec journalists that weakened the leverage of the malicious negotiators impact ta inhibit system recovery t data destruction t service stop   t data encrypted for impact t network denial of service t according to malwrhunterteam this could be the first ransomware that does vm snapshots cleaning   the latter deletes also shadow copies and the recycle bin according to vxunderground the latter deletes decryption keys as previously seen alphv payloads have the capability to stop services and kill processes to increase the impact with the help of the enumservicesstatusexw function to enumerate all the active services and deletes services if the service name matches the list present in the config file simple extortion encryption of sensitive data triple extortion as an additional extortion method the threat actors threaten to ddos victims unless they pay a ransom connectwise formerly known as screenconnect that is a legitimate remote administration tool was leveraged this tool was already seen abused in the past by other ransomcartels such as revil upon the recent massive attack against kaseya and apts since another legitimate tool keystore explorer that can be used to create and navigate keystores via its intuitive graphical interface was reported though it is not yet clear if there is any link with alphv at this stage see here one could conjecture that this tool was leveraged to generate unique key pairs for each victim but should be considered as a false positive zip and rclone were reported by speartip as the toolset use for exfiltration of data no known vulnerabilities are yet reported to be leveraged by the affiliates of this raas program to the best of our knowledge we should mention though that sentinelone telemetry indicated a primary delivery of blackcat is via rd party frameworktoolset eg cobalt strike or via exposed and vulnerable applications we should mention that other entry vector remain extensively used rdp brute force attacks or unsecure rdpvpn connections it is also likely that this advanced threat actor if not already could rapidly leverage an initial access broker to provide to its affiliates a foothold on a victim network keep in mind that such initial access brokers iabs could also leverage the last vulnerability that defrayed the

alphv for data exfiltration with relevant sigma rules such as here and here alphv it is worth mentioning here that an opensource tool has been recently developed by the cto of nextron florian roth for deception purposes available on github named raccine this tool can detect and stop any windows process trying to delete the shadow volumes on a system that can be triggered by alphv payloads or by

httpsidransomwareblogspotcomblackcatransomwarehtml a json file format compatible with the mitre attck navigator highlights shared tactics techniques and procedures ttps according to the mitre attck framework of a representative payload targeting windows systems leveraged by alphv as far as registry key modification is concerned a reverse engineering analysis showed that alphv ransomwares targeting windows embed the following command see figure reg add hkey_local_machinesystemcurrentcontrolsetserviceslanmanserverparameters v maxmpxct d t reg_dword fenum_serv figure screenshot highlighted the registry key adding in ransomware code aiming at exalting the spreading via psexec upon the attack in some of those payloads a reverse engineering analysis unravelled attempts to bypass windows user account control uac to stealthy execute code with elevated permissions t this technique is also known as the com elevation moniker that allows running applications under uac to activate com classes with elevated privileges more precisely we found a globally unique identifier clsid efcfaafbec bit hexadecimalnumbers within a pair of curly braces can be retrieved in the registry path workstationhkey_local_machinesoftwareclassesappidefcfaafbec that could be associated with the cmstpluadll aka connection manager admin api helper for setup such clsid is usually leveraged for detecting bypass uac via an autoelevated com interface in the same vein as was reported by sophos in april in the case of lockbit ransomware alphv will ensure to exalt damages by checking whether or not its process owns administrator rights via openprocesstoken function if not the latter masquerades as windows explorer explorerexe by calling coinitializeex initializing the com library  then the hex value clsid is added to the moniker and executed we also found another typical string referred to as evationadministratornew that is similar to the expected value elevationadministratornew as indicated in the microsoft documentation which allows apps running under uac to activate com classes with elevated privileges see figure figure uac bypass via the com elevation moniker such uac bypass capability was previously seen in the threat landscape embedded into ransomwares such as medusalocker avaddon revil darkside blackmatter note that strong ttp overlapping was reported between medusalocker and avaddon but also darkside and blackmater as aforementioned in the same vein here is a json file format compatible with the mitre attck navigator of

arnaud zobec thursday august threat spotlight headlines securex threats another threat actor is actively exploiting the socalled printnightmare vulnerability cve cve in windows print spooler service to spread laterally across a victims network as part of a recent ransomware attack according to cisco talos incident response research while previous research found that other threat actors had been exploiting this vulnerability this appears to be new for the threat actor vice society talos incident responses research demonstrates that multiple distinct threat actors view this vulnerability as attractive to use during their attacks and may indicate that this vulnerability will continue to see more widespread adoption and incorporation by various adversaries moving forward for defenders it is important to understand the attack lifecycle leading up to the deployment of ransomware if users have not already they should download the latest patch for printnightmare from microsoft in this post well analyze the various ttps used in a recent ransomware attack from vice society that leveraged this vulnerability many of these same ttps are commonly observed in other ransomware attacks such as a previously published analysis of a wastedlocker attack vice society is a relatively new player in the ransomware space they emerged in mid and have been observed launching biggame hunting and doubleextortion attacks primarily targeting small or midsize victims this group also has notably targeted public school districts and other educational institutions as they are a new actor in this space vice societys ttps are difficult to quantify however based on incident response observations they are quick to leverage new vulnerabilities for lateral movement and persistence on a victims network they also attempt to be innovative on endpoint detection response bypasses as with other threat actors operating in the biggame hunting space vice society operates a data leak site which they use to publish data exfiltrated from victims who do not choose to pay their extortion demands below is an example screenshot of this site throughout the course of our analysis of a recent humanoperated ransomware attack associated with vice society we observed several notable tactics techniques and procedures ttps used throughout each stage of the attack lifecycle some of the most interesting characteristics of this attack were the use of utilities such as proxychains and impacket during the postcompromise phases of the attack lifecycle the targeting of backups to prevent recovery following ransomware deployment the degradation of esxi servers used for virtualization in victim environments the use of a dll that takes advantage of the recently discovered printnightmare vulnerability for which microsoft has previously released a security update attempts to bypass native windows protections for credential theft and privilege escalation below are some key examples of the ttps used in this attack as they relate to the mitre attck framework attck technique system owneruser discovery t attck technique account discovery t attck technique domain trust discovery t once initial access was achieved several techniques were observed being leveraged to conduct postcompromise discovery and reconnaissance within the environment we observed attempts to access the backup solution employed in the environment likely to prevent the organization from successfully recovering without paying the demanded ransom the sudo command was used to obtain credentials associated with a commercial backup solution likely trying to gain access to backups present within the environment sudo s k p backup prompt whoami we also observed the use of impacket a common network protocol manipulation tool to enumerate the environment and obtain additional information about the active directory configuration in place this is typically done to identify highvalue targets that may be attractive as attacks attempt to maximize their sphere of influence over as much of the environment as possible prior eventually deploying ransomware and making their presence known below are some examples of the command line syntax used for the performance of this activity cmdexe q c net group enterprise admins domain admin__stirng cmdexe q c net group domain admins domain admin__string we observed enumeration of the domain trust relationships present within the environment the adversaries used the nltest command for this purpose cwindowssystemnltestexe dclistlinux hostname attck technique command and scripting interpreter windows command shell t attck technique command and scripting interpreter powershell t attck technique windows management instrumentation t attck technique system services service execution t similar to what was observed during the postcompromise reconnaissance phase of the attack the adversary used impacket to execute windows management instrumentation wmi to achieve command execution on other systems present in the environment the attacker also used the proxychains utility which is often employed to redirect network traffic during penetration testing red teaming and other offensive operations cmdexe q c proxychains impacketexampleswmiexecpy hashes sha hash usernameip address admin__string we also observed the adversary using windows batch files to execute psexec in this case psexec remotely authenticated and executed powershell on remote systems within the environment cmdexe c csbat psexecexe d hostname u domainusername p password accepteula s cmd c powershellexe executionpolicy bypass file hostnamespps there were also artifacts in the environment that indicate that the recently disclosed printnightmare vulnerability may have been used during this attack a dll associated with printnightmare was observed on systems within the environment as described in the section credential access attck technique create or modify system process t in many biggame hunting ransomware attacks upon achieving initial access into the target environment the adversary will first attempt to achieve persistence so that they can regain access to the environment if they are detected or their initial point of access is otherwise removed in this particular case we observed the adversary leveraging a windows service to execute powershell to stay persistent in the environment the windows service was configured with the following options service type user mode service service start type demand start service account localsystem service name updater service filename comspec c start b windirsystemwindowspowershellvpowershell nop sta w enc base encoded blob as can be seen above the powershell being executed was base encoded the decoded powershell instructions are below this powershell is responsible for the performing the following tasks disabling powershell logging bypassing amsi protection for powershell downloading decrypting and executing a backdoor payload from an attackercontrolled server by implementing this persistence the attacker can regain access to the environment if the targeted organization destroys their initial means of access attck technique remote services t attck technique lateral tool transfer t once operational within the target environment attackers will typically perform reconnaissance identifying additional target systems and then move laterally from system to system as they attempt to escalate privileges and then ultimately deploy ransomware on many systems in the environment during the investigation we observed the attacker leveraging windows remote desktop connections to pivot to additional systems in the environment this was typically performed via the following commandline syntax cwindowssystemmstscexe v hostname the attacker also attempted to execute powershell scripts on remote systems in the environment while moving systemtosystem cmd c powershellexe executionpolicy bypass file ipaddresssharepps during the attack adversaries copied and executed the aforementioned powershell script on multiple systems across the environment attck technique os credential dumping t attck technique os credential dumping lsass memory t the actor attempted to extract credentials from the victim in two ways accessing the active directory global catalog file ntdsdit and utilizing comsvcsdll comsvcsdll is a wellknown way to extract lsass local security authority subsystem service data by invoking comsvcsdll with rundllexe an adversary can create a dump of any process this is a classic and clever livingofftheland binary lolbin tactic that avoids popular credential extraction tools like mimikatz which may alert defenders we also observed attempts to dump the ntdsdit which is a database of active directory information examples of the commandline syntax used in these cases are below cmdexe q c powershell ntdsutilexe ac i ntds ifm create full ctemp q q admin__string cmdexe q c powershell ntdsutilexe ac i ntds ifm create full ctemp_logs q q admin__string the actor also utilized printnightmare a recently published series of vulnerabilities by microsoft that would allow remote code execution when an improper print spooler performs privileged file operations this attack vector is notable in the ubiquitous nature of print services in all modern corporate enterprises microsoft has recently released a security patch for printnightmare we encourage all enterprises to patch immediately to avoid exploitation attck technique indicator removal on host clear windows event logs t attck technique modify registry t attck technique impair defenses or modify tools t throughout the attack the adversary made multiple attempts to evade detection and subvert security controls in place as described throughout previous sections of this blog post we also observed the attacker attempting to clear the contents of security logs on compromised systems the following commandline syntax was observed being used to clear the system security and application windows event logs cwindowssystemwevtutilexe cl system cwindowssystemwevtutilexe cl security cwindowssystemwevtutilexe cl application the adversary was also observed remotely modifying the windows registry on remote systems to disable remote administration restrictions to facilitate lateral movement and privilege escalation activities disabling this security control allows attackers to leverage passthehash attacks and hinder rdps security on systems cmdexe q c powershell newitemproperty path hklmsystemcurrentcontrolsetcontrollsa name disablerestrictedadmin value propertytype dword force admin__string we also observed the attacker disabling windows defender by modifying the windows registry on compromised systems this was performed using the following commands cwindowssystemregexe delete hklmsoftwarepoliciesmicrosoftwindows defender f cwindowssystemregexe add hklmsoftwarepoliciesmicrosoftwindows defenderrealtime protection v disableroutinelytakingaction t reg_dword d f cwindowssystemregexe add hklmsoftwarepoliciesmicrosoftwindows defenderspynet v disableblockatfirstseen t reg_dword d f we also observed the threat actor attempting to evade detection while enumerating the environment using an amsi bypass which is often used as a way to evade detection by endpoint security solutions that may be present on compromised systems in this case the windows command processor was used to invoke powershell which then leveraged invokeexpression iex for this purpose cmdexe q c powershellexe exec bypass noni nop w c iex netservicepointmanagerservercertificatevalidationcallbacktruetryrefassemblygettypesystemmanagementautomationamsiutilsgetfieldamsiinitfailednonpublicstaticsetvaluenulltruecatchquser attck technique exfiltration over alternative protocol t over the past couple of years we have observed an increasing number of ransomware threat actors adopting a doubleextortion methodology in their attacks in these attacks adversaries attempt to exfiltrate large quantities of sensitive information for the purposes of further extortion against victims this data once exfiltrated is published to attackercontrolled websites that are commonly referred to as data leak sites in situations where the victim chooses not to pay the ransom demand in this attack we observed the adversary attempting to exfiltrate sensitive information over smb tcp directly from a compromised domain controller this was likely chosen as a way to bypass egress filtering that may have been in place at the perimeter of the victim environment it can be difficult to account for the myriad ways an attacker can compromise and inflict malware on a network given the techniques demonstrated here it can feel overwhelming as a defender to account for every avenue of attack the good news is that there are several lessons we can learn about this incident logging is critical for forensics ensure there is reliable and secure logging infrastructure in place utilize multifactor authentication to make credential theft more difficult to exploit look at egress filtering for firewalls and ensure malicious traffic cannot call out to adversary infrastructure utilize an endpoint detection response platform that detects lolbin abuse and malware implants keep uptodate and offline backups that cannot be targeted by adversaries as demonstrated throughout this post attackers often make use of a variety of tactics techniques and procedures as they work to accomplish their mission objectives in some instances there is significant overlap and similarities between the approaches taken by distinct threat actors they often leverage dualuse tools for various purposes to minimize their footprint and evade detection likewise adversaries are constantly refining their approach to the ransomware attack lifecycle as they strive to operate more effectively efficiently and evasively the use of the vulnerability known as printnightmare shows that adversaries are paying close attention and will quickly incorporate new tools that they find useful for various purposes during their attacks multiple distinct threat actors are now taking advantage of printnightmare and this adoption will likely continue to increase as long as it is effective it is important that defenders be aware of the various ttps being used throughout the attack lifecycle so that they are prepared to prevent detect and respond to nefarious activity that may be indicative of a successful compromise of their environment failure to do so

research intelligence in various incidents including darkside and snatch ransomware operations threat actors leveraged tor and onion services to create backdoors that gave them ongoing access to compromised networks thursday may by counter threat unit research team in and secureworks counter threat unit ctu researchers observed several threat groups using the official tor client to create a backdoor with persistent access to compromised networks via remote desktop protocol rdp thirdparty researchers documented similar activity during a mid intrusion the tor client can be used to create a local socks proxy that allows proxyaware applications to access the tor network tor can also create onion services originally known as hidden services that can then be accessed through the tor network the threat actors create an onion service that allows a remote attacker to connect to the rdp service on the compromised host by default tor stores metadata used to maintain a connection to the tor network in the appdatator directory the location of this directory can be changed by modifying the datadirectory directive in the configuration file an alternative path to a configuration file can be provided to the tor client at runtime with the f commandline parameter the folders creation time is the moment tor was first executed by the user within this directory the lock files modification timestamp matches the time the tor client was last executed tor periodically updates the state file its modification timestamp can vary up to a few minutes from the tor clients last activity while running the tor client maintains an open session with the tor network that brokers inbound connections to the onion service when a remote attacker connects to the onion address and port pair registered as the onion service the connection is redirected to the ip address and port specified in the hiddenserviceport configuration directive when the hiddenserviceport directive is configured as the loopback ip address the connection is redirected to the localhost beginning in mid ctu researchers analyzed several incidents where threat actors leveraged an onion service on a compromised system to redirect inbound requests to the local rdp service the financially motivated gold waterfall threat group perpetrated two of these incidents one of which included deployment of the darkside ransomware the threat actors installed tor into the cwindowsinfusb folder and executed it via the following command line cwindowsinfusbtortorexe f cwindowsinfusbconfigdat to maintain the tor clients persistence gold waterfall used the nonsucking service manager nssmexe to install tor as a service figure shows the tor configuration figure tor configuration used by gold waterfall source secureworks ctu researchers discovered another victim that had a domain controller containing an identical setup installed during or before april this victims network was not infected with ransomware it is unclear if gold waterfall had access to this host but at the time the group was a revil ransomware affiliate in a separate incident observed in february a threat actor distributing the snatch ransomware set up a tor backdoor using the configuration in figure the configuration file and other tactics techniques and procedures ttps match details in a june thirdparty report on snatch ransomware activity figure tor configuration used during snatch ransomware incident source secureworks to keep the tor client running the threat actors executed a servicebat windows batch script to create a service using the service control scexe commandline utility see figure figure creation of service to keep tor client running source secureworks although the threat actors used these backdoors in all of the analyzed intrusions it is possible that the backdoors were created by initial access brokers iabs who compromised the victims networks the iabs sell the credentials a summary of the victims environment number of endpoints etc and the onion address hosted within the network the windows event log writes the following three events when a threat actor successfully authenticates via rdp exposed using this type of tor backdoor the data in the figures is contrived for demonstration purposes event logon type network is written to the security log the account name is the user whose credentials are compromised and the workstation name is the computer name used by the attacker see figure figure windows event indicates a successful logon source secureworks event is written to the terminal services remote connection manager log the expected source network address is the remote ip address of the connecting user but this activity uses loopback address see figure figure windows event indicates successful rdp authentication source secureworks event is written to the terminal services local session manager log this event also contains the anomalous loopback address in the source network address field see figure figure windows event indicates successful rdp session reconnection source secureworks tor is designed to operate within adversarial environments where governments or other wellresourced entities attempt to deny or monitor internet communication blocking published tor entry nodes at network egress points may be effective against tor clients that use the default protocol tor clients that use bridges and pluggable transports are much more difficult to block because the infrastructure is more dynamic and cannot be compiled into easily consumed lists intrusion prevention systems ips are often capable of performing the deep packet inspection necessary to identify obfuscated tor traffic to mitigate exposure to this threat ctu researchers recommend that organizations use available controls to review and possibly restrict access using the indicators in table additional information about the gold waterfall threat group that operates the darkside

subscribe the dfir report real intrusions by real attackers the truth behind the intrusion menu analysts contact us services subscribe pm thursday june meterpreter ransomware rdp yara june another rdp brute force ransomware strikes again this time snatch team snatch team was able to go from brute forcing a domain administrator da account via rdp to running a meterpreter reverse shell and a rdp proxy via tor on a domain controller dc to encrypting all domain joined systems in under hours snatch is a widely known variant due to it causing systems to reboot into safe mode before encrypting the system sophoslabs has an excellent write up on snatch which was very similar to what we witnessed snatch team logged into a da account from around utc initially with that access they performed a simple arp a at utc the threat actors made the next move running ipconfig and quser just minutes later they began lateral movement initiating an rdp session with a dc once on the dc the threat actor moved quickly deploying a tool set in cwindows this tool set included executable that masqueraded as windows management instrumentation files one was executed with the following command parameters the dat file turned out to be a configuration file with the executable being tor creating an rdp tunnel wouldnt this be really really slow the other executable file in the wmis folder was a go executable of unknown providence potentially related to utorrent capability the next thing they did was create a reverse shell using what we think is meterpreter c initiated over https to via cplxenexe the presence of logs indicating the use of named pipe services also increases the likelihood of meterpreter or possibly cobaltstrike we didnt see any et pro signatures fire for this activity but we also didnt have ssl inspection on at the time a separate executable was then dropped for stealthy persistence of cplxenexe xexe is a loader that uses the dlls which are ini files below to run cplxen jdobnsdll cwindowssystemcplxenexe f fwaaadll kbsdll two scheduled tasks were created to launch the loader which in turn persists the loading of cplxenexe xexe had a very low vt hit ratio if anyone wants to investigate this further feel free to contact us to get the file or get it on mispvt about a half hour after successful c we see this we can conclude that ditsnap was most likely run on the dc to obtain a copy of ntdsdit by creating a snapshot fortyfive minutes later snatch team had their first blood they rdped into the backup server turned off windows defender and executed safeexe they did this for every machine in the domain and within minutes all machines were ransomed including the dcs all machines rebooted into safe mode before encrypting causing all logging and remote tools to fail damn you safe mode on all machines we are left with the following snatch team requested k usd for the decryptor but with negotiations we were able to talk them down to less than k lets take a minute to think about what recovery would look like in a large organization every server and online machine was rebooted into safe mode without networking which causes you to lose complete visibility this gets very painful quickly as weve seen time and time again rdp is being brute forced to gain access into the network and then the threat actor moves laterally quickly to install ransomware although we were surprised that the threat actors manually rdped into each system rather than using gpo or psexec even though this attacker did not seem highly skilled they were productive efficient and in less than hours could have earned k k per hour enjoy our report please consider donating or more to the project using patreon thank you for your support safeexe is a go based executable it drops bat files that kick off the ransom process it creates a new service to run safeexe and then sets the system to reboot into safe mode on next boot and then executes a shutdown of the system asap

brute forcing rdp to install ransomware this time the brute forced system was not using the default rdp port the threat actors installed ransomware on two machines including a domain controller in minutes we saw a tweet the other day that said just pysamespinoza ransomware intro over the course of hours the pysamespinoza threat actors used empire and koadic as well as rdp to move laterally throughout the environment grabbing credentials from as many systems as possible on the way to their objective the threat actors took their time looking for files and reviewing dharma ransomware an attacker logged into the honeypot via rdp from within minutes the attacker went from local admin to domain admin to installing ransomware on multiple machines the attacker used defender control to turn off defender and then used mimikatz to dump credentials from there the attacker used network the little ransomware that couldnt dharma ransomware againbut we changed the rdp port search for

ransomware by lawrence abrams april pm the robbinhood ransomware is the latest player in the ransomware scene that is targeting companies and the computers on their network this ransomware is not being distributed through spam but rather through other methods which could include hacked remote desktop services or other trojans that provide access to the attackers since it first came out samples of the robbinhood ransomware have not been easy to come by yesterday though malwarehunterteam was able to find a sample so that it could be reverse engineered and tested to learn more about it recommended by as we previously stated it has not been confirmed how the ransomware gains access to a network and the computers on it skip ad continue watching after the ad visit advertiser website go to page play top stories video settings full screen about connatix v read more read more read more read more read more read more barracuda says hacked esg appliances must be replaced immediately security researcher vitali kremez who reverse engineered the sample  told bleepingcomputer that on execution robbinhood disconnects all network shares from the computer using the following command cmdexe c net use delete y this means that each computer is targeted individually and that other computers are not encrypted via connected shares kremez told us that this could indicate that the payload is being pushed to each individual machine via a domain controller or through a framework like empire powershell and psexec one of the most notable ones is cmdexe c net use delete y since the malware does not encrypt or crawl any shares and actually disconnects from network which indicates each variant is likely pushed into each machine via the domain controller or some other automated means maybe via psexec before continuing the ransomware will now attempt to read a public rsa encryption key from cwindowstemppubkey if this key is not present it will display the following message and the ransomware will exit cant find pubkey error if a key is present it will continue preparing the victims computer for encryption to test the ransomware bleepingcomputer generated a test public key and saved it to cwindowstemp next it will stop windows services associated with antivirus database mail server and other software that could keep files open and prevent their encryption it does this by issuing the scexe stop command as shown below cmdexe c scexe stop avp y a full list of services stopped by robbinhood are found at the end of the article during this preparation stage robbinhood will also clear shadow volume copies clear event logs and disable the windows automatic repair by executing the following commands vssadminexe delete shadows all quiet wmic shadowcopy delete wevtutilexe cl application wevtutilexe cl security wevtutilexe cl system bcdeditexe set default recoveryenabled no bcdeditexe set default bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures now that the computer is prepped it begins to encrypt the victims targeted files kremez told bleepingcomputer that when encrypting files an aes key is created for each file the ransomware will then encrypt the aes key and the original filename with the public rsa encryption key and append it to the encrypted file each encrypted file will then be renamed using the format encrypted_randomstringenc_robbinhood as shown below encrypted robbinhood files when encrypting files robbinhood will skip any files found in or under the following directories programdata windows bootmgr boot windowsbt windowsold temp tmp program files program files x appdata recyclebin system volume information while running robbinhood has the ability to send debug output to the console this feature is currently disabled in distributed versions of the ransomware and does not have a runtime value to enable it the ransomware will though create numerous log files under the cwindowstemp folder these files are called rf_ ro_l and ro_s log files it is not currently known what each log file is for other than the rf_s file which is used to log the creation of ransom notes in each folder example logfile for robbinhood ransom note creation after encryption has been completed these log files will be deleted  below is an example of some of the debug messages that would be displayed during this cleanup stage if console output was enabled cleaning up logs furthermore if console output is enabled in the ransomware when done encrypting a computer it will display a final message stating enjoy buddy as shown below final message when robbinhood is done encrypting while encrypting the computer it will also create four different ransom note named _decrypt_fileshtml _decryption_readmehtml _help_help_helphtml and _help_importanthtml these ransom notes contains information as to what has happened to the victims files and a bitcoin address that they can use to make a ransom payment the ransom payments are currently set at bitcoins per affected system or  bitcoins for the entire network robbinhood ransom note unfortunately at this time no weakness has been found in the ransomware and there is no way to decrypt files for free as ransomware is only damaging if you have no way of recovering your data the most important thing is to always have a reliable backup of your files these backups should be stored offline and not made accessible to ransomware which have been known to target backups in the past while this ransomware is not being spread via spam it is possible that it is being installed by trojans that are therefore it is important that all users be trained on how to properly identify malicious spam and to not open any attachments without first confirming who and why they were sent finally it also important to make sure that your network does not make remote desktop services publicly accessible via the internet instead you should put it behind a firewall and make it only accessible through a vpn update added further info about debug logs bcfffceadfbefcfabeedfadb _decrypt_fileshtml _decryption_readmehtml _help_help_helphtml _help_importanthtml cwindowstemppubkey

https://www.goggleheadedhacker.com/blog/post/12,robbinhood malware analysis with radare goggleheadedhackerlearn how to reverse engineer golang malware using radare this article will explain how the gopclntab works and how we can use it to extract function names this process is explained using the robbinhood ransomware that attacked baltimoregoggleheadedhacker robbinhood malware analysis with radare july gopclntab robbinhood tutorial radare malware analysis malware linux windows scripting automation rpipe golang more content like this onenote analysis intro to cutter blackguard analysis deobfuscation using dnlib analysis of logjshell attack reverse engineering crypto functions aes reverse engineering crypto functions rc and salsaabout projects contact by jacob pimental this article will provide an overview of how we can extract function names from windows golang binaries to make reversing easier and to give a brief analysis on the robbinhood ransomware that attacked baltimore recently golang is a programming language designed around multithreaded applications the difficulty in reversing golang binaries is that all libraries are statically linked which means there will be a large number of functions in the application most of which are not even used during execution for example in a normal hello world compiled golang binary radare detects functions the gopclntab section in a golang program contains a table of function locations along with their names radare is able to parse out this table and label every function accordingly however this only works on binaries compiled for linux when it comes to windows radare is not able to find the gopclntab and we are left with thousands of unlabeled functions with no clue as to what they do i decided to learn how the gopclntab works and create a parser using rpipe to label all functions the gopclntab section always seems to start with the bytes xfbffffff and after that contains the size of the table the next bytes contains the location of the first function then the offset of that function from the start of the table if you go to that offset from the start of the table youll get the offset for the name of the function using this table we can get all of the function information for the binary i created a small python script that uses rpipe to parse this table and renamecreate the necessary functions you can get the script on my github there is also a really indepth article you can read about the gopclntab here in may baltimore was hit by a ransomware known as robbinhood that took out multiple services the ransomware itself was written in golang so i thought this would be a good opportunity to become familiar with golang reversing and analyze the sample when reversing a golang binary the main function will be located at mainmain seeking to that function in radare we can see the binary trying to open the file cwindowstemppubkey strings in a golang binary are not nullterminated like most ctype programming languages instead they have a variable that contains the length of the string if the file pubkey does not exist the program throws an error and exits if it does exist the program will get a list of drives that the computer has access to and run the function maincoolmaker the coolmaker function spawns multiple processes of cmdexe to run the service control manager in order to to shut down any endpoint agents or antivirus on the infected host after the coolmaker function has been called robbinhood will spawn processes of the function mainmainfunc which appears to be where the actual encryption occurs the function calls another function maindoit which creates an encryption key based on the pubkey file found at the start of execution these processes will then recursively walk through the file system and encrypt any files it finds the program also logs the encrypted files names to four different log files rf_l rf_s ro_l ro_s both of the rf_ files log the names of the files the program deems interesting the ro_ logs contain all other filenames both sets of logs are separated into large file sizes rf_l ro_l and small file sizes rf_s ro_s these logs are deleted as soon as execution is completed the dropped ransom note is contained in the binary as a base encoded string the different aspects of the note such as payment amount and user id are defined by different variables in the note to make them easily interchangeable depending on who the victim is for example the wallet id is defined in the ransom note as wallad and is replaced by the string yosdpebximnogvucmsnbwuhlutfj i did check to see if any payments had been made to the bitcoin wallet address and it looks like jack young was true to his word and the city didnt pay the ransom at all overall this was not a very advanced ransomware it is very loud due to the fact that it is shutting down multiple endpoint agents and av it also did not have the ability to spread at all every infected computer had to be targeted individually for it to cause real damage however this was a fun sample to analyze and taught me a lot about golang reversing as always if you have any questions or comments on this or any of my other articles feel free to reach out to me on my twitter and linkedin thanks for reading and happy reversing buy me a tea,Cyber Security

minute read share this article fresh attacks target companies employees promising millions of dollars in exchange for valid account credentials for initial access the lockbit ransomwareasaservice raas gang has ramped up its targeted attacks researchers said with attempts against organizations in chile italy taiwan and the uk using version of its malware attacks in july and august have employed lockbit according to a trend micro analysis released on monday featuring a soupedup encryption method in contrast to lockbits attacks and features in this version includes automatic encryption of devices across windows domains by abusing active directory ad group policies prompting the group behind it to claim that its one of the fastest ransomware variants in the market today according to the report lockbit prides itself on having one of the fastest and most efficient encryption methods in todays ransomware threat landscape our analysis shows that while it uses a multithreaded approach in encryption it also only partially encrypts the files as only kb of data are encrypted per file the attacks also feature an effort to recruit insider threats from within targeted companies trend micro noted the last step of the malwares infection routine is to change the wallpaper on victim machines to whats effectively an advertisement with information on how organization insiders can be part of the affiliate recruitment with guaranteed payouts of millions of dollars and anonymity in exchange for credentials and access according to the report the fresh spate of attacks are employing the tactic seemingly to remove middlemen of other threat actor groups and to enable faster attacks by providing valid credentials and access to corporate networks according to the researchers lockbit it should be noted recently made headlines as the culprit behind the accenture cyberattack lockbit infection routine for initial access to a targeted corporate network the lockbit gang recruits affiliates and helpers as mentioned who perform the actual intrusion on targets usually via valid remote desktop protocol rdp account credentials to help the cause lockbits creators provide their partners with a handy stealbit trojan variant which is a tool for establishing access and automatically exfiltrating data the report pointed out that once in a system lockbit uses a panoply of tools to case the joint as it were a network scanner takes stock of the network structure and identifies target domain controllers it also uses multiple batch files for various purposes including terminating security tools enabling rdp connections clearing windows event logs and making sure that crucial processes such as microsoft exchange mysql and quickbooks are unavailable it also stops microsoft exchange and disables other related services but thats not all lockbit also abuses legitimate tools such as process hacker and pc hunter to terminate processes and services in the victim system after this first stage its time for lateral movement once in the domain controller the ransomware creates new group policies and sends them to every device on the network trend micro researchers explained these policies disable windows defender and distribute and execute the ransomware binary to each windows machine this main ransomware module goes on to append the lockbit suffix to every encrypted file then it drops a ransom note into every encrypted directory threatening double extortion ie the note warns victims that files are encrypted and may be publicly published if they dont pay up the final step for lockbit is changing the victims desktop wallpapers into the aforementioned recruitment ad which also includes instructions on how victims can pay the ransom lockbits continued evolution trend micro has been tracking lockbit over time and noted that its operators initially worked with the maze ransomware group which shut down last october maze was a pioneer in the doubleextortion tactic first emerging in november it went on to make waves with big strikes such as the one against cognizant in summer it formed a cybercrime cartel joining forces with various ransomware strains including egregor and sharing code ideas and resources after mazes shutdown the lockbit group went on with its own leak site which led to the development of lockbit researchers explained the previous version showed characteristics of readymade ransomware using the double extortion techniques of encrypting files stealing data and leaking the stolen data when the ransom was not paid now lockbit shows influences from ryuk and egregor perhaps due to shared code dna two notable examples flagged by trend micro are wakeonlan feature inspired by ryuk ransomware sending the magic packet xff xff xff xff xff xff to wake offline devices print bombing of the ransom note onto the victims network printers similar to egregors technique of attracting the victims attention it uses winspool apis to enumerate and print a document on connected printers weassume that this group will continue to make a scene for a long time especially since its currently recruiting affiliates and insiders making it more capable of infecting many companies and industries trend micro researchers concluded it would also be wise to assume and prepare for upgrades and further developments in lockbit especially now that many companies are aware of its capabilities and how it works how to protect organizations from ransomware the center of internet security and the national institute of standards and technology recommend the following best practices for preventing lockbit and other malware infections share this article breach malware suggested articles student loan breach exposes m

resurfaced in june with lockbit with reports indicating an increased number of targeted companies and the incorporation of double extortion features our detections followed attack attempts in chile italy taiwan and the uk from july to august by jett paulo bernardo jayson chong byron gelera nikki madayag mark marti cris tomboc sean torre august read time min words save to folio subscribe the ransomware group lockbit resurfaced in june with lockbit  with reports indicating an increased number of targeted companies and the incorporation of double extortion features influenced by ransomware families such as ryuk and egregor in contrast to lockbits attacks and features in  this version includes automatic encryption of devices across windows domains by abusing active directory ad group policies prompting the group behind it to claim that its one of the fastest ransomware variants in the market today the group also includes an advertising campaign to recruit new affiliates from inside the target companies themselves in its attacks seemingly to remove middlemen of other threat actor groups and to enable faster attacks by providing valid credentials and access to corporate networks from july to aug  we detected attack attempts involving lockbit  in chile italy taiwan and the uk we advise organizations and users to update their systems and enable multilayered defense mechanisms accordingly figure the countries affected by lockbit based on our telemetry from july to aug lockbit  routine and updates figure the infection chain of lockbit lockbit  prides itself on having one of the fastest and most efficient encryption methods in todays ransomware threat landscape our analysis shows that while it uses a multithreaded approach in encryption it also only partially encrypts the files as only  kb of data are encrypted per file like other ransomwareasaservice raas operations lockbit  looks for affiliates to perform the intrusion and exfiltration on targets the group behind it also helps affiliates by providing stealbit detected by trend micro as trojanspywinstealbityxbhm a tool that can automatically exfiltrate data attackers can also access victims systems with valid remote desktop protocol rdp accounts once in a system lockbit  uses a network scanner to identify the network structure and to find the target domain controller it also uses multiple batch files that can be used to terminate processes services and security tools there are also batch files for enabling rdp connections on the infected machine the following are the tools and components that ensure lockbits smooth execution delsvcbat detected by trend micro as trojanbatkillprocd ensures that crucial processes such as mysql and quickbooks are unavailable it also stops microsoft exchange and disables other related services avbat detected by trend micro as trojanbatkillavwldx uninstalls the antivirus program eset logdeletebat detected by trend micro as puabatdharmaa clears windows event logs defoffbat detected by trend micro as trojanbatkillavwldx disables windows defender features such as realtime monitoring lockbit  also abuses legitimate tools such as process hacker and pc hunter to terminate processes and services in the victim system  terminate processes and services in the victim system once in the domain controller the ransomware creates new group policies and sends them to every device on the network these policies disable windows defender and distribute and execute the ransomware binary to each windows machine we found lockbit_dabfdafexe detected by trend micro as ransomwinlockbitsmyebgw as the main ransomware module that appends lockbit to every encrypted file once lockbit  completes encrypting a device it drops a ransom note restoremyfilestxt detected by trend micro as ransomwinlockbitsmanote into every encrypted directory the note emphasizes that files are not only encrypted but also at risk of being published if the ransom is not paid figure the lockbit ransom note dropped into every encrypted directory lockbit  also changes the desktop wallpaper into an image with instructions on how victims can pay for the ransom and how organization insiders can be part of the affiliate recruitment of the group behind the ransomware the group guarantees payouts of millions of dollars and anonymity in exchange for credentials and access figure the lockbit ransom note as a desktop wallpaper ryuk and egregor influences lockbit worked with the maze ransomware cartel and was previously dubbed the ransomware abcd because of the extension it appended to encrypted files before updating to the current extension but after mazes shutdown the lockbit group went on with its own leak site which led to the development of lockbit in september  the previous version showed characteristics of readymade ransomware using the double extortion techniques of encrypting files stealing data and leaking the stolen data when the ransom was not paid two years later lockbit  shows influences of and similarities to ryuk and egregor particularly with regard to certain notable behaviors wakeonlan feature inspired by ryuk ransomware sending the magic packet xff xff xff xff xff xff to wake offline devices figure sending the magic packet to devices print bombing of the ransom note onto the victims network printers similar to egregors technique of attracting the victims attention it uses winspool apis to enumerate and print a document on connected printers figure enumerating printers figure the writeprinter api used to print ransom notes on printers conclusion the group behind lockbit  recently conducted a highly publicized attack  so it should go without saying that organizations need to keep a wary eye on this ransomware variant lockbit  is especially tricky for its fast encryption we also assume that this group will continue to make a scene for a long time especially since its currently recruiting affiliates and insiders making it more capable of infecting many companies and industries it would also be wise to assume and prepare for upgrades and further developments in lockbit  especially now that many companies are aware of its capabilities and how it works best practices given its persistence speed of propagation and methods of intrusion lockbit  is likely to cause significant damage to its victims be it financial or reputational here are some best practices from the frameworks set by the center of internet security and the national institute of standards and technology that can help organizations prevent and mitigate the impact of attacks involving ransomware like lockbit  audit and inventory take an inventory of all organizational assets and data and identify authorized and unauthorized devices software and personnel accessing particular systems audit and monitor all logs of events and incidents to identify unusual patterns and behaviors configure and monitor deliberately manage hardware and software configurations and only grant administrative privileges and access to specific personnel when absolutely necessary monitor the use of network ports protocols and services implement security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers and have a software allow list to prevent malicious applications from being executed patch and update perform periodic vulnerability assessments and conduct regular patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications ensure that all installed software and applications are updated to their latest versions protect and recover enforce data protection backup and recovery measures implement multifactor authentication in all devices and platforms used whenever available secure and defend perform sandbox analysis to examine and block malicious emails employ the latest version of security solutions to all layers of the system including email endpoint web and network spot early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system and enable advanced detection technologies such as those powered with ai and machine learning train and test perform security skills assessment and training for all personnel regularly and conduct redteam exercises and penetration tests trend micro solutions organizations can benefit from security solutions that encompass a systems multiple layers endpoint email web and network not only for detecting malicious components but also for close monitoring of suspicious behaviors in the network trend micro vision one provides multilayered protection and behavior detection spotting questionable behaviors that might otherwise seem benign when viewed from only a single layer for an even closer inspection of endpoints trend micro apex one offers nextlevel automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats and ransomware this allows detecting and blocking ransomware early on before it can do any real damage to the system with techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning trend micro cloud one workload security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities it also takes advantage of the latest in global threat intelligence to provide uptodate realtime protection ransomware often gets into the system through phishing emails trend micro deep discovery email inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to

threat research ai research security news sophos life an unpatched microsoft exchange server let both ransomware actors in karma just stole data while conti encrypted written by sean gallagher february threat research bazar cobalt strike conti featured karma proxyshell ransomware security operations in early december a healthcare provider in canada was hit by two separate ransomware actors with very different tactics  the first ransomware group identified as karma exfiltrated data but did not encrypt the targets systemsbecause the targeted organization was in healthcare they claimed in the ransom note dropped on the targets pcs the second group identified as conti came onto the network later but had no such reservations less than a day after the karma gang dropped their ransom notes the conti actors deployed their ransomware sophos rapid response team had just begun talking with the targeted company hours earlier and the customer had not yet deployed sophos software to the portion of the network where ransomware had been staged by the conti gang existing nonsophos antimalware measures did not impede the attack we have several cases of ransomware affiliates using proxyshell to penetrate victims networks recently including affiliates of conti and we have seen past examples of multiple actors exploiting the same vulnerabilit y to gain access to a victim but very few of those cases have involved two simultaneous ransomware groups both attackers gained entry via proxyshell exploits targeting cve cve and cve on microsofts exchange server platform  the first intrusion using the exploit was on august as recorded in the iis access log get autodiscoverautodiscoverjson evilcorpowaemailautodiscoverautodiscoverjsonfevilcorpcorrelationidemptycafereqidfebabcbfc mozillamacintoshintelmacosx__applewebkitkhtmllikegeckochromesafari the commands that followed exploited the exchange management shell to create an administrative account administrator and retrieve scripts from three remote serversone in hong kong another in iran and the last in russia prior to the attack the compromised organization was utilizing sophos onpremises antivirus being reliant on signaturebased detection this was inadequate for detection of the proxyshell exploit because proxyshell uses web communications to exploit a trusted application and does not deploy malware the administrator account would later be used by one of the actors for lateral movement while it cannot be confirmed from the available data this first exploit was likely made by an access broker who later sold access to one or both of the ransomware operators at this point the customer reached out to sophos support for assistance to load a product on to their exchange servers while the customer had noticed email being sent automatically from some users the focus was on installing the thirdparty product and the intrusion was not discovered at this time a second set of intrusions using the proxyshell exploit chain occurred on november this attack installed a web shell on the exchange servers iis web server instance after these intrusions while continuing to assist the customer with the thirdparty product on their exchange servers sophos support recognized there may be indications of compromise and escalated the case for response assistance actual efforts to more deeply penetrate the network began in earnest weeks later between november and system logs showed over failed attempts and efforts to connect to other servers including a domain controller as well as a successful connection by the account administrator to another web application server from the mail server at some point on november the administrator account was used to access an rdp session on a virtual machine or workstation which was used to make the login attempts  this activity appears to be connected to the karma gang meanwhile another compromised account made a series of remote desktop protocol connections to other servers from a different compromised endpoint and executed powershell commands downloading cobalt strike beacons from the same host used for scripts on november on november  after a few attempts on other systems the attacker using administrator account successfully connected to another system launching batch scripts that installed cobalt strike beacons as a service cobalt strike was deployed to email servers domain controllers and a few other systems with more being targeted the next day collection began as well on december with the creation of rar archives of data on multiple systems on december and the karma gang finished gathering data and pushed it up to the mega cloud storage serviceexfiltrating gigabytes of archived files then the karma malware was deployed using the compromised administrator account the malware distributed the ransom note through a service created on each targeted system which copied the note from its original location and launched a batch filefor example comspec c echo del ckarma_ransomware_readmetxt systemdrivewindowstempqwvvyzfhbjxadiratxt windowstempuiotiudorgdzimrdbat comspec c start comspec c windowstempuiotiudorgdzimrdbat coming into work on december employees of the targeted organization found the karma ransom note as wallpaper on about workstations and servers the ransom note claimed that data had only been exfiltrated and not encrypted because the karma gang had identified the target as a healthcare organization at that time the organization called in sophos rapid response team and a kickoff teleconference was held early on december and monitoring tools were put in place to begin to understand what had happened but within a few hours of the beginning of the rapid response engagement the second ransomware group launched its attack two compromised accounts were active on december the administrator account and a second account with administrative privileges one of these accounts installed the chrome browser on the primary file server then by way of the compromised administrator account malware was deployed to one of the organizations servers the sample dll was identified by sophoslabs as conti it was loaded using regsvrexe as part of its execution a batch file defbat was launched containing commands to disable windows defender on the targeted server this took place even as karma was dropping ransom notes on additional systems meanwhile the targeted organizations network defenses detected and blocked cobalt strike activity coming from one of the organizations mail servers not the one serving as point of entry the detected cobalt strike c communications were to a server in a netherlands datacenter operated by a bulgarian hosting company the second compromised account was used to download cobalt strike beacons to additional systems across the network shortly after that the second compromised account was used to drop a script into a local folder on a domain server that powershell script  named getdatainfops gathered network data via windows management instrumentation queries and sent it back to a remote command and control server  part of the script was recovered from system logs it searches for software of interest on computers on the network including antimalware and backup software as well as other software that might interfere with encryption by

gigabytes worth was exfiltrated to mega using the chrome browser dropped on the file server earlier in the day this appears to be the conti groups exfiltration moments later the conti ransomware attack began in earnest with the defbat file deployed to suppress windows defender detection the ransomware encrypted files on the c drive of affected systems and dropped the conti ransom note these dual ransom attacks highlight the risks associated with wellknown internetfacing software vulnerabilitiesat least ones that are wellknown to malicious actors but may not be to the organizations running the affected software all sizes of organizations can fall behind on vulnerability managementwhich is why having multiple layers of defense against malicious activity is important malware protection on servers as well as clients can impede ransomware operators from using unprotected servers to launch their attacks in this case the initial access came over months before there was any ransomware activity this suggests the likelihood of an access broker discovering the proxyshell vulnerability and either offering it for sale on a marketplace or simply sitting on it until ransomware affiliates wanted it despite network monitoring and some malware defenses both attackers in this case were able to largely accomplish their tactical goals only a few systems had sophos malware protection at the time of the conti attack as the targeted organization had not yet had time to deploy it in the few cases where sophos had been deployed ransomware protection detected conti launching but the ransomware was largely run from servers without protection as a result much of the organizations data was encryptedas were the karma ransom notes sophos detects karma and conti ransomware by behavior and signature in this case conti was detected as trojcontic and trojransomglu and blocked by cryptoguard on protected systems the bazar script was detected by behavior as membazarldc

threat actor having first been observed in june of the group has targeted numerous organizations across different industries reports of a group with the same name from are not related to the actors currently using the name an initial technical analysis of a single sample related to karma was published by researchers from cyble in august in this post we take a deeper dive focusing on the evolution of karma through multiple versions of the malware appearing through june in addition we explore the links between karma and other well known malware families such as nemty and jsworm and offer an expanded list of technical indicators for threat hunters and defenders karmas development has been fairly rapid and regular with updated variants and improvements oftentimes building multiple versions on the same day the first few karma samples our team observed were sample dedefefccdcbaeeaffbc sample afcddebfdaabdeba sample cfcbcefadcecf sample was compiled on th june and samples and the following day on the th a few minutes apart basic configuration between these samples is similar though there are some slight differences such as pdb paths after sample we see more of the core features appear including the writing of the ransom note upon execution these payloads would enumerate all local drives a to z and encrypt files where possible further hunting revealed a number of other related samples all compiled within a few days of each other the following table illustrates compilation timestamps and payload size across versions of karma compiled in a single week note how the payload size decreases as the authors iterate ransom note is not created in sample also the list of excluded extensions is somewhat larger in sample than in both samples and and the list of extensions is further reduced from sample onwards to only exclude exe ini dll url and lnk the list of excluded extensions is reduced as the malware authors iterate from sample onwards the malware calls createiocompletionport which is used for communication between the main thread and a sub threads handling the encryption process this specific call is key in managing efficiency of the encryption process parallelization in this case individual files are encrypted by way of a random chacha key once files are encrypted the malware will encrypt the random chacha key with the public ecc key and embed it in the encrypted file chacha encryption across samples to the author removed the createiocompletionport call instead opting to create a new thread to manage enumeration and encryption per drive we also note the karma mutex created to prevent the malware from running more than once ransom note names have also been updated to karmaencryptedtxt diving in deeper some samples show that the chacha algorithm has been swapped out for salsa the asymmetric algorithm for ecc has been swapped from secpk to sectr some updates around execution began to appear during this time as well such as support for command line parameters a few changes were noted in samples and the main difference is the newly included background image the file backgroundjpg is written to temp and set as the desktop imagewallpaper for the logged in user desktop image change and message from our analysis we see similarities between jsworm and the associated permutations of that ransomware family such as nemty nefilim and gangbang specifically the karma code analyzed bears close similarity to the gangbang or milihpen variants that appeared around january some highlevel similarities are visible in the configurations we can see deeper relationships when we conduct a bindiff on karma and gangbang samples the following image shows how similar the main functions are the main function argument processing in gangbang left and karma the main body of the ransom note text hasnt changed since the first sample and still contains mistakes the ransom notes are baseencoded in the binary and dropped

emailtutanotacom emailprotonmailcom each sample observed offers three contact emails one for each of the mail providers onionmail tutanota and protonmail in each sample the contact emails are unique suggesting they are specific communication channels per victim the notes contain no other unique id or victim identifier as sometimes seen in notes used by other ransomware groups in common with other operators however the karma ransom demand threatens to leak victim data if the victim does not pay the address of a common leaks site where the data will be published is also given in the note this website page appears to have been authored in may using wordpress the karma ransomware groups onion page karma is a young and hungry ransomware operation they are aggressive in their targeting and show no reluctance in following through with their threats the apparent similarities to the jsworm family are also highly notable as it could be an indicator of the group being more than they appear

up to date a new massive leaked database named collection made headlines last week after troy hunt published that he uploaded the database to his haveibeenpwned website this database has caused a lot of questions across the industry so we wanted to provide an update on what weve found and how intsights customers will know if they are impacted troy hunt got his database from a site named raidforums the user that published the data in raid forums just happened to stumble across it in meganz a known cloud file storage and sharing platform figure the original post is dated january but that user wasnt the source of the collection they just passed along a meganz link which was originally published by a user named sanix figure raidforums post we know that because two hours before the post in raidforums another post was published in a separate forum named nulledto this post by a user named azatej was the post the drove this collection into public knowledge figure azatej complained about sanix and the fact that they shared the collection to meganz and advised people to steer clear from them the reason for azatejs complaint was because sanix has exposed combo lists from azatejs combo selling platform in that meganz link azatej decided to release the entire collection to the forum as well azatej also claimed that most of the data inside the collection is from or older and its not actionable for committing targeted attacks as a great percentage of it is old and outdated figure nulledto post the user sanix is most likely of russian origin as evidenced by their interface language on the screenshot of the database they sent as proof figure from the dates in the files it seems as this collection was assembled around november and that sanix had started selling it around the start of december figure user sanixs db for sale there is a great deal of hype around this combo collection due to the sheer size of it however combo lists are nothing new as with any chain mail or other internet phenomenon combo lists are usually circulated over the course of many years and contain old recycled data thats already been exposed with that said you can never be too cautious so its important to monitor for and analyze new data dumps especially ones of this size collection intsights obtained the collection database last week and we are continuing to process and analyze the data customers have been receiving alerts if any of their data or credentials are contained within the database we will continue to track any further developments and will keep you updated as we keep

conti group leaked share this article facebook twitter email linkedin cyberark labs share this facebook twitter email linkedin the conflict in ukraine has driven significant attention from the cybersecurity community due in large part to the cyber attacks conducted against ukraine infrastructure including evidence of destructive malware such as whispergate and hermeticwiper weve also seen certain ransomware groups gain increased media attention such as the conti ransomware group that is currently in the spotlight because of leaked information about the inner workings of the group including its common tactics techniques and procedures ttps as cybersecurity researchers we believe insight gained from these leaks is incredibly important to the cybersecurity community at large ongoing awareness and visibility into the leaked tools while supporting the need for continued vigilance is critical during this time and reinforced by groups like the cybersecurity and infrastructure agency cisa that recently issued a joint cybersecurity bulletin with the fbi whats in the leaked files and why it matters in the next section we will elaborate about the leaked content and why its important the primary source is this site httpssharevxundergroundorgconti figure this folder contained chats from june of until november of the same year it seems one user in particular frequently spams all the other users for example figure this can also be a useful tool for us to investigate since we can see maybe even all the usernames in one place allowing us to enumerate all the people in the conti group this folder contains git repositories of allegedly internal software by conti upon quick inspection of these repositories most of the code appears to be opensource software that is used by the conti group for instance yii or kohana is used as part of what seems to be the admin panel the code is mostly written in php and is managed by composer with the exception of one repository of a tool written in go logs and databases are not present in the dump so no actual data is available aside from a peek into how the backend of the operation may have looked at a certain point some of the tools are related to older versions but theres no indication of whether the dump was from a long time ago or whether conti just used older versions a few of the config files contained in those repositories has local database usernames and passwords listed eg adminmasterdebbeffcfafaecbapplicationconfigdatabasephp developer_ vb default type postgresql connection hostname localhost port username admin_user password asfbnasgfgydsgjkzs persistent false database admin primary_key column to return from insert queries see and schema table_prefix charset utf caching false developer_ vb default type postgresql connection hostname localhost port username admin_user password asfbnasgfgydsgjkzs persistent false database admin primary_key column to return from insert queries see and schema table_prefix charset utf caching false developer_     vb         default             type       postgresql            connection                 hostname   localhost                port                       username   admin_user                password   asfbnasgfgydsgjkzs                persistent false                database   admin                        primary_key     column to return from insert queries see and             schema                   table_prefix             charset      utf            caching      false        there are a few public ip addresses present in some of the torrc config files iptables script files or tinc script files pony leaks contains a collection of credentials and certificates from multiple sources it looks like a collection thats been stolen by the pony credential stealing malware it includes email accounts and passwords from multiple organizations and mail services like gmailcom mailru and yahoocom usernames and passwords from ftp rdp and ssh services and credentials from different websites conti rocket chat leaks contains a chat history of conti members in which they discuss about targets and tips to perform attacks via cobalt strike techniques from the chat active directory enumeration sql databases enumeration via sqlcmd how to gain access to shadow protect spx storagecraft backups how to create ntds dumps vs vssadmin how to open new rdp port list of tools cobalt strike metasploit powerview sharefinder anydesk mimikatz in some of the leaked screenshots we can see the conti groups cobalt strike panel in a kali linux distribution figure the other screenshots contained another screenshot of the cobaltstrike panel and some related to contirecovery chats the conti toolkit leak zip contains two main folders the first is called teamtnttools which unsurprisingly contains tools used by the apt teamtnt specifically it contains zip files with the ngrok and sugarlogic tools both are tools that use shellbash scripts to target various operating systems as well as aws and kubernetes the other folders name is in russian and loosely translates to manual for hard workers and software this appear to be an updated version of the content that was leaked by a disgruntled conti affiliate onto the xss forum in august of and contains contis training manual for their partners one of the leaked files is a dump of forum chats from the trickbot forums including correspondences in the forum from until while most of the correspondences contain instructions for operators about how to laterally move across networks and how to use certain tools used by the trickbot ganggroup we did find some interesting bits from the different correspondences and toolset dumps we can learn a lot about the trickbot and conti gangs ttps for instance in one of the correspondences a member shares his web shell of choice the lightest and most durable webshell i use figure we also found some evidence from early july that the group used exploits such as zerologon figure as well as techniques such as kerberoasting to carry out their attacks figure on a different post the group shares some code to dump mssql credentials figure on a different post from february a user in the forum shares his code for a powershell script to install a backdoor on a victims machine including installing tor ssh and setting up a firewall rule as well as a new user account on the victims machine called oldadministrator figure figure also in a post they are sharing techniques to stop everything short version for brevity reasons in order to have all applicationsdbs closed before encryptinglocking a server figure there were more leaks of two trickbot serverside components written in erlang supposedly by sergey loguntsov httpsgithubcomloguntsov aka begemot the two components are trickbotcommanddispatcherbackend and trickbotdatacollector backend dubbed lero and dero additionally the conti locker source code was leaked first as a password protected zip file but later it was leaked again this time without any password the zip contents include conti locker v source code as well as the source code for the decryptor an older leak that also contained some older training materials of the conti group contained archive files with different topics such as cracking metasploit network pentesting coblat strike powershell for pentesters windows red teaming wmi attacks and defenses sql server active directory reverse engineering figure some of the archives contain videos of online courses in russian figure to improve defenders ability to protect against the next wave of targeted attacks and destructive malware information sharing and deeper analysis and insight into the use of particular ttps is critical in many ways we believe what we are seeing today could potentially be the tip of the iceberg which is why we cant let up on our efforts to support ongoing awareness and hyper cybersecurity vigilance further reading conti taking

nothing to hide from whom surely you want to hide your children from abusers and predators dont you want to hide your banking details from con artists and fraudsters your identity from identity thieves your location from burglars your car keys from car thieves or your blood type from rich mobsters with kidney problems we dont know who are any of these things so we should protect ourselves from all of them in effect we have everything to hide from someone and no idea who someone is source user cortic on hacker news were going over the requirements and criteria in order for a privacy tool or service to be listed opensource we love the opensource community software and services recommended on privacytoolsio are opensource unless marked closedsource since almost all of our entries are opensource weve decided not to point that out every single time in some cases developers decide to release the client source code but not the server or backend code the tag partially opensource is used for these entries usability is the app or service userfriendly and easy to use a modern and welldesigned interface makes it easy to understand for users and therefore can be widely adopted generally we dont recommend commandline interface cli tools but there can be exceptions if there is no other alternative affected entries are tagged with for experts if they require a complicated setup or usage active development were there any recent updates a privacy tool or service that is still under active development is by far preferred over outdated projects exceptions no alternatives are available or the tool is in a stable state with no known issues that could pose a security threat or leaks that could harm your online privacy crossplatform tools and services that are available on several devices and operating systems are preferred to be listed here we believe its making the life of the end user easier and it helps to convince users to switch to a privacyrespecting alternative publicly available invite only services providers and tools are not getting listed to convince users to switch to more privacyrespecting alternatives the onboarding process should be as easy and fast as possible jurisdiction ideally providers their companies and ceos listed here are not based in a five eyes country usa canada uk australia and new zealand we likely exclude chinese or russian services on a casetocase basis over censorship concerns privacy guide how is the five eyes intelligence alliance related to your privacy and wikipedia lavabit suspension and gag order and the connection to edward snowden security audits ideally the toolservice received an independent security audit from a reputable cybersecurity firm this is optional since opensource developers often cant afford the high costs that are involved to hire a security auditor picocrypt screenshot is a perfect example of a great privacy tool that struggles to receive funding for an audit entries are marked with a audited tag in our entries examples remark an audit is not proof that software is safe and secure some flaws can be overlooked even by the best auditors valid only for a snapshot of the code if new code is added new vulnerabilities can be introduced business model everything became a paid subscription lately to counter this we try to find tools and services that you can use for free or offer a freemium version we also prefer paid services that offer fair moneyback guarantee and free trials test of time time often reveals if a privacy tool or service can stand the test of time if relevant we provide information when privacy service companies are founded and if any significant incidents happened since founding court cases also reveal if the company kept promises to its users time is also a good factor to judge if widespreadadoption was achieved and if it was accepted by a broad user base sponsorships sponsors can be exempted from the criteria generally our sponsors follow the same ideology and fulfill most criteria innately more details about our project funding example nordpass ticks off most boxes of our criteria it has been audited is available crossplatform under active development and its easy to use it has been tagged with closedsource since the company decided not to release the source code to the public a term for a regularly published statement that a service provider has not received legal process that it would be prohibited from saying it had received such as a national security letter transparency reports and warrant canaries have an important role to play in the fight against illegal and unconstitutional national security process including national security letters and other secret court processes wikipedia many of the activities we carry out on the internet leave a trail of data that can be used to track our behavior and access some personal information some of the activities that collect data include credit card transactions gps phone records browsing history instant messaging watching videos and searching for goods unfortunately there are many companies and individuals on the internet that are looking for ways to collect and exploit your personal data to their own benefit for issues like marketing research and customer segmentation others have malicious intentions with your data and may use it for phishing accessing your banking information or hacking into your online accounts businesses have similar privacy issues malicious entities could be looking for ways to access customer information steal trade secrets stop networks and platforms such as ecommerce sites from operating and disrupt your operations privacy tools are software that can help people control the information that they share with others they are also known as privacy software privacy apps and privacy utilities many privacy tools and services can be downloaded or used for free while others are commercial services that charge a monthly subscription fee privacy tools are software that can help people control the information that they share with others they are also known as privacy software privacy apps and privacy utilities opensource software is an application whose source code is available to modify therefore businesses can use these tools to create security solutions that are tailored to their specific security needs some of the benefits of using opensource software include reliability as it is created by expert developers and sometimes volunteers this creates an opportunity for other experts to check for flaws and correct them in the end you get software that is very resilient and highly reliable for crafting security solutions such privacy tools are also flexible unlike proprietary software where the vendor sets limits and lockins that prevent some functions these tools are highly flexible for use in various applications besides users do not have to follow a rigid set of requirements when using the software if you have been browsing online making transactions and interacting with others online without any form of security the chances are someone is collecting your data tracking you or looking for ways to manipulate your data it is time to take control of your data by choosing the right privacy tools for your activities there are various tools for your security each offering specific qualities to deal with online challenges read on to determine the best privacy tools for individual use and for your business below privacy in a nutshell free and opensource software foss for the win privacy is the ability to seclude any information about themselves from access or scrutiny by other parties this way they can express themselves selectively and prevent others from accessing their information unfortunately governments and marketing companies are always surveying the general population for various reasons among which are security marketing research or even malicious intentions privacy tools help us to use internet resources without being surveyed or having our personal space intruded by other parties anonymity is the situation where the identity of the person conducting the activity is unknown it is part of privacy in that other parties cannot pin a name on the doer of the activities in question for example when you are browsing anonymously the tracking companies cannot tell who is visiting their website therefore they cannot follow up with marketing or any due to your online behavior encryption is the technique of translating data from one form to another so that only people with the right decryption key can access and understand the data encryption prevents criminals from tapping and hacking data on transit for malicious reasons encryption is usually part of privacy on the other hand online security involves the use of tools to prevent issues such as intrusion of privacy access and theft of personal and company data phishing and attacks on the online tools these privacy tools help you enhance your anonymity when conducting activities online vpn that supports unlimited devices surfshark off audited win mac linux android ios bitcoin

in early for some that is a core feature not a problem but for those who need a little more anonymity the public nature of the bitcoin blockchain is a huge privacy flaw there are ways of keeping bitcoin transactions entirely private to obscure who sends what to whom one of the most popular methods is to use a bitcoin mixer also known as a tumbler these are tools that jumble up an amount of bitcoin in private pools before spitting them out to their intended recipients the idea is that by shuffling bitcoin through a black box its difficult to work out that person a sent bitcoins to person b all a public explorer will show is that person a sent some bitcoin to a mixer as did a dozen other people and that person b received some bitcoin from a mixer as did a dozen other people there are two main types of bitcoin mixers centralized mixers like blenderio decentralized mixers such as wasabi and joinmarket centralized mixers are companies that will accept your bitcoin and send back different bitcoins for a fee while they offer an easy solution for tumbling bitcoin they also still present a privacy challenge as while the links between incoming and outgoing bitcoin will not be public the mixer itself will still have a record that connects the transactions meaning that in the future the company could give up those records and reveal a users connection to the coins decentralized mixers employ protocols such as coinjoin to fully obscure transactions via either a coordinated or peertopeer method basically the protocol allows a large group of users to join together an amount of bitcoin ie people want to mix bitcoin each and then redistribute it so everyone gets bitcoin back but no one can tell who got what or where it came from mixers are not without their flaws its unlikely that someone else in the mixer sent the exact amount of bitcoin as you minus the tumblers fee if a law enforcement agency knows the address used by its first suspect and if the second suspect is the only one to have received a little less of a specific amount its not going to be too hard to reconnect the flow of money this problem becomes harder to solve the more people use the mixer some exchanges dont allow mixed bitcoin to enter or leave exchanges since exchanges can identify mixers they label mixed bitcoin tainted binance for instance has blocked withdrawals to wasabi a privacypreserving bitcoin wallet that integrates a popular mixing service called coinjoin other popular bitcoin mixers include samourai and joinmarket its important to note that not all mixing services are legitimate and some are far less effective at obscuring financial transactions than others be sure to do your research before using a mixer the ability to obfuscate bitcoin transactions makes mixers an obvious hotbed for money laundering attracting the likes of tax dodgers and criminals interested in hiding the proceeds of illegal activity the question of whether using these services is illegal depends on which jurisdiction you are based in in february thenus deputy assistant attorney general brian benczkowski said that using mixers to hide crypto transactions is a crime two months later us authorities arrested roman sterlingov aka the russianswedish founder of bitcoin tumbling service bitcoin fog for helping people launder million in august larry harmon the owner of a bitcoin mixer called helix pleaded guilty to helping darknet market criminals launder around million new antimoney laundering rules like the financial action task forces travel rule and the european unions amld directive will make laundering money tougher and could make bitcoin tumblers less viable for people who want to join in the wider crypto economy the sort that relies on popular exchanges accepting your coins read more what are privacy coins and are they legal a bitcoin mixer isnt the only way to hide the flow of bitcoin transactions after hacks criminals often siphon funds through lots of exchanges using accounts created with cheaply bought or stolen identities this method known as chainhopping relies on the fact it takes law enforcement a long time to force exchanges to shut down accounts plus its tricky for exchanges to spot dodgy accounts in the first place if they have already passed through knowyourcustomer kyc procedures privacy advocates maintain that methods like privacy coins are a powerful way to prevent the government from snooping on your financial transactions asserting they are not just for criminals to obscure the flow of funds monero uses onetime use stealth addresses and mixes genuine transaction signatures with decoys while one of the first major dark web marketplaces the silk road had a bitcoin tumbler baked into its infrastructure former

that can obfuscate the data linking you to bitcoin transfers bitcoin mixing is extremely beneficial for those who want to regain complete privacy of their transactions and funds because it makes count tracing impossible bitcoin mixers or bitcoin tumblers have become a necessity as many cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms require personal documents to prove identity the use of these services has taken away the core feature that made blockchain technology so famous in the first place privacy with the complete and transparent records of all transactions being easily available online to anyone who cares to investigate them one can easily trace your name to an amount of crypto you own its not about hiding your identity or crypto portfolio however it comes to that too by now its no secret that governmental organizations such as the nsa are tracking down bitcoin users but tracking crypto can be done by anyone with an internet connection not just secret governmental agencies even cryptocurrency exchanges track transactions coming from gambling websites blocking those funds the suspicion is that the money could be a result of money laundering operations a bitcoin mixer is a software service that breaks down your funds into smaller sets and subsequently mix it with other transactions after this process we call bitcoin tumbling the recipient gets the same value in bitcoin but receives a different set of coins this makes bitcoin tracing more difficult and breaks the link between those specific coins and an individual some of the best bitcoin tumblers and mixers help you break the connection between your identity and the btc you own when you use a bitcoin blender you receive new coins disassociated from your identity and thats how you can regain your privacy these services have a small fee and confuse bitcoin tracking solutions tracing those transactions there are a few different ways of anonymizing your bitcoins for instance there are peertopeer coin tumblers that act as a meeting place for bitcoin users but that requires all users to come together to form a bitcoin exchange apart from the mixer server the participants are not aware of the bitcoin addresses for input and output of the transactions weve analyzed the best bitcoin mixers and tumblers you can use to protect your identity and came with some of the best coin tumblers you can use right now like we shared daily in our community on telegram in the beginning the crypto community envisaged bitcoin as a completely anonymous medium for financial transactions but in todays more mainstream cryptocurrency environment most cryptos have lost the privacy feature in favor of wider adoption in order to be compliant with international regulations and new digital assets laws most of the platforms need to verify each users identity and they often disclose it with third parties that might not bother crypto users and investors but you might simply not want others to know how much bitcoin you own how much money you earn or how you decide to spend your funds that is your private affair and thats why you dont go out on the streets shouting how much money you have in your bank account by disassociating your btc from your identity you regain your privacy and can use your funds with peace of mind regardless of where those funds came from disclaimer please acknowledge that we

coin mixing service along with a darknet bitcoin mixer search engine also known as gram he was charged with money laundering for creating an unlicensed money transfer platform however using a bitcoin mixing software was not the cause of the problem here helix bitcoin mixer io and bestmixer was an unauthorized coin mixing business connected with other larrys companies and gram the darknet tor based search engine the government confiscated all of his bitcoin and his service was shut down due to the illegal operation of a btc mixer so what does this mean for you as a bitcoin user right now bitcoin mixers bitcoin mixer dark web are more in a gray area that many governments dont like to see because it means they miss out on a lot of taxes and they always want to be in control of people in order for an exchanger service to be recognized as legal they have to go through the legal due process and register with the authorities they also have to show that they have no involvement in illegal business and illegal activities and store and show all the data of users and confirm their identity we are far from a complete bitcoin privacy and authorities are always on the lookout for suspicious activity from most coin tumblers in we saw the closure of bestmixerio a centralized bitcoin blender among other tumblers it shows that there is a thin line between privacy and violations of the law therefore it is important to make sure that you choose a bitcoin mixing service that does not store any user data before using any bitcoin mixer tumbler bitcoin it is crucial to read a bitcoin mixer review on bitcoin mixer wiki coinomize is a great example of a topnotch perfect bitcoin tumbler that you can use without fear of having your privacy violated on the internet it offers complete anonymity of your transactions and user data and leaves no traces for authorities or hackers trying to track your transactions there is a common myth that bitcoin is an untraceable mode of payment and can be used to pay for illicit activities by criminals those that believe this myth often think that bitcoin is untraceable and therefore cant be tracked besides they also believe that private information is safe and cannot face exposure it is not always the case to some extent bitcoin offers privacy in comparison to other modes of payment especially those involving thirdparty businesses like credit cards however it does not provide complete anonymity like the one given by cash transactions it is possible to trace a person through their bitcoin transactions and gain some valuable information bitcoin is a peertopeer decentralized digital currency its transactions do not involve the use of thirdparty platforms to support transactions but that doesnt mean theres no way to track transactions this is where the socalled blockchain comes into play ever heard of it the blockchain acts as the ledger for bitcoin it is publicly viewable and operated by many independent computers that record each bitcoin transaction in units called blocks therefore bitcoin transactions leave a public digital trail that can be traced back to the bitcoin address owner transactions are not completely untraceable so the use of bitcoin mixing service is recommended to obscure personal information about the owner on the blockchain with coinomize you get untraceable coins bitcoin laundering bitcoin mixer money laundering is often used as a method of maintaining anonymity in bitcoin transactions it allows your financial life to remain anonymous however a question arises is it safe well the answer depends on the bitcoin laundering service you use choose a trustworthy bitcoin tumbler service that wont run off with your bitcoin you should carefully check the features they offer and how much value is placed on privacy and anonymity and how long data is stored if you research keenly before conducting any transaction using a bitcoin laundry service then your transactions are safe if not you risk putting your coins and your privacy at risk your private information could be exposed and transactions tracked back to you if you dont research keenly therefore check for reviews before using any coin tumbler cryptomixer have been in play for quite some time now in an attempt to address the privacy issues related to bitcoin they help safeguard your privacy during transactions to prevent such transactions being traced back to you however not all mixers are safe and it calls for you to research to ensure that whatever service you are using your privacy is of utmost concern if you are looking for a bitcoin mixer api a bitcoin mixer eu you can find some on github bitcoin mixers are anonymous bitcoin is a public ledger and all transactions can be seen by anyone on the blockchain this means that if you were to use a bitcoin mixer it would be virtually impossible for you to prove that it was your transaction besides the use of a top bitcoin mixer you should also consider a few other things to make anonymous bitcoin transactions buy your coins through a vpn or do all blockchain transactions over the tor network and choose a provider peertopeer that requires as little personal information from you as possible use an anonymous bitcoin wallet hardware on your computer and do not use online providers to store your bitcoins before you want to withdraw your

research from blockchain analytics and crypto compliance firm elliptic has revealed the extent to which crosschain bridges and decentralized exchanges dexs have removed barriers for cybercriminals in an oct report titled the state of crosschain crime elliptic researchers eray arda akartuna and thibaud madelin took a deep dive into what they described as the new frontier of crypto laundering the report summarized that the free flow of capital between crypto assets is now more unhindered due to the emergence of new technologies such as bridges and dexs cybercriminals have been using crosschain bridges dexs and coin swaps to obfuscate at least billion worth of illicit crypto proceeds since the beginning of it reported around a third of all stolen crypto or roughly billion from the incidents surveyed was swapped using decentralized exchanges delving further into the details the report noted that more than half of the illicit funds it identified were swapped directly through two dexs curve and uniswap with the inch aggregator protocol coming a close third a similar amount of around billion has been laundered using coin swap services that allow users to swap assets within and across different networks without having an account many are advertised on russian cybercrime forums and cater almost exclusively to a criminal audience it noted sanctioned entities are increasingly turning to such technologies in order to move funds and carry out cyberattacks according to elliptic wallets connected to groups eventually sanctioned by the united states including those used by north korea to perpetrate multimilliondollar cyberattacks have laundered more than billion through such techniques in a june report on digital asset risks global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog

as a top choice for crypto laundering with the vast majority of illicit assets or more than million passing through it ren has become particularly popular with those seeking to launder the proceeds of

products are soon to follow speaking to cointelegraph nana murugesan coinbases vice president of international and business development said building during bear markets has paid off big time during the bull run and that hes confident in what he sees in the local market the baseline signals murugesan explains such as the local awareness of crypto and people who view it as the future of finance are kind of on par or even better in australia compared to the united states and other markets australia definitely punches way way over its weight in the apac region certainly at a global level too and from a revenue contribution standpoint i feel pretty good about what its going to do murugesan explained that it started with building a localized infrastructure incorporating a local entity coinbase australia pty ltd and obtaining registration to provide digital currency exchange services with the australian transaction reports and analysis centre the countrys financial intelligence agency weve been very impressed with the open door that weve received in canberra and with different policymakers murugesan said adding the exchange has received tough questions regarding its platform and token listings given the token mapping exercise thats going on there are a lot of technical questions that we are getting from the treasury and other departments deep technical questions is another thing that we are seeing in australia at a level deeper than some other countries initially coinbase is providing australian crypto traders with new fast payments for local bank accounts access to its advanced trading platform and chat support which murugesan sai opens the door for the company to launch its full range of institutional and development products while he didnt have a specific timeline on when the products will become available murugesan added that he knows australian institutions will want to do everything locally and added that coinbase will be very much focused on institutions in the coming months the exchange will also collaborate with rmit universitys blockchain innovation hub to assess web opportunities in the country murugesan added that its working with the university of new south wales and others to create related courses and assist in research programs related rushing token mapping could hurt aussie crypto space finder founder murugesan said th as coinbase looks to further expand into asia he sees regulation as a business enabler as resources are limited especially during a bear market with some countries in the region having unclear crypto policies its likely it will focus more towards markets that have clarity or are going towards clarity he said he mentioned the high level of interest g nations have in crypto and how blockchain and digital currencies fit into the future of finance expecting it to be a hot topic among g member nations by next year adding theres a lot of interest among australian policymakers to take a leadership

moneywatch by khristopher j brooks february pm moneywatch hackers stole a record billion worth of cryptocurrency globally last year led by thieves tied to north korea according to a blockchain analytics firm that tracks cybercrime researchers at chainalysis called the biggest year ever for crypto hacking in a report published last week thefts rose from billion stolen in the firm reported separately a confidential united nations report found that north korea stole more cryptocurrency assets last year than in any other year reuters reported on monday during the coronavirus pandemic us investors poured millions into bitcoin ether dogecoin and other popular tokens in hopes of generating a fortune but some investors instead suffered losses due to hackers with their digital wallets plundered on platforms with poor cybersecurity north korean cybercriminals shattered their own yearly record for most cryptocurrency stolen and tallied billion in thefts in the chainalysis report said given that north koreas total exports in totaled million it isnt a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nations economy the researchers added as more investors lost money in crypto us lawmakers have reignited their calls to regulate the crypto industry scrutiny of the sector grew even more intense in november when ftx trading the third largest crypto platform suddenly collapsed and declared bankruptcy ftx bankruptcy filing shows unprecedented mess the number of crypto hacks ebbed and flowed in with big spikes in march and october chainalysis said october was the biggest single month ever for cryptocurrency hacking with attacks totaling million lost according to the report hackers have focused their activities on decentralized finance or defi platforms which were tied to of stolen funds last year chainalysis said criminals typically strike when crypto investors are using a socalled crosschain bridge to transfer funds from one blockchain to another the biggest hack from october took place when someone looted million in crypto from a crosschain bridge owned by binance the company acknowleged the hack and said its security officers were able to minimize the loss bad actors can exploit defi platforms because some crypto companies havent prioritized security said david schwed the chief operating officer at blockchain security firm halborn a big protocol should have to people on the security team each with a specific area of expertise schwed said in chainalysis report the defi community generally isnt demanding better security they want

cryptocurrency was stolen from various services last year with much of those thefts driven by north koreanlinked hackers according to a report wednesday from blockchain analytics firm chainalysis the increase in crypto heists from billion in came as the overall market for cryptocurrencies suffered significant declines the value of bitcoin for example fell by more than last year north korea was a key driver for the surge in thefts according to the report hackers linked to the country stole an estimated billion worth of crytopcurrency through various hacks in up from million in the prior year chainalysis said senator elizabeth warren a democrat from massachusetts speaks during a senate banking housing and urban affairs committee hearing on ftx in washington dc us on wednesday dec us prosecutors in manhattan yesterday revealed eight criminal counts against the ftx founder and federal regulators said he committed a range of securities and derivatives law violations ting shenbloomberggetty images elizabeth warren crypto giants are collapsing under the weight of their own fraud some of the biggest crypto hacks of the year have since been attributed to north korea the fbi has blamed hackers linked to the north korean government for more than million hack of video game axie infinitys ronin network in march and a million harmony a cryptocurrency firm in june north koreas total exports in totalled million worth of goods so it isnt a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nations economy chainalysis noted in the report us officials worry pyongyang will use money stolen from crypto hacks to fund its illicit nuclear and ballistic weapons program north korean hackers have stolen the equivalent of billions of dollars in recent years by raiding cryptocurrency exchanges according to the united nations in addition to hacking cryptocurrency firms suspected north koreans have posed as other nationalities to apply for work at such firms and send money back to pyongyang us agencies have publicly warned adchoices advertisement in general decentralized finance defi protocols were the main target of hackers accounting for more than of all cryptocurrency stolen for the year according to the report these protocols are used to replace traditional financial institutions with software that allows users to transact directly with each other via the blockchain the digital ledger that underpins cryptocurrencies of the attacks on defi systems targeted crosschain bridge protocols which allow users to exchange assets between different blockchains bridge services typically hold large reserves of various coins making them targets for hackers the thefts on axie infinity and harmony were both bridge hacks while crypto hacks continued to rise last year there is some cause for hope law enforcement and national security agencies are expanding their abilities to combat digital criminals such as the fbis recovery of million worth of cryptocurrency stolen in the axie infinity hack those efforts combined with other agencies cracking down on money laundering techniques means that these hacks will get harder and less fruitful with

a different address were adding your address to our list dont show me this again previous monday review the hot stories of the week next senator calls for dedicated us data protection agency by lisa vaas the guy who allegedly wanted to be the dark nets goto money launderer by acting as a bitcoin mixer soliciting cryptocurrency from crooks slicing and dicing the coins and then remixing them in an ultimately futile attempt to obscure their source has been busted the us department of justice doj announced on thursday that larry harmon of akron ohio has been indicted on three counts of allegedly running a bitcoin mixer service called helix from to these services are also called bitcoin tumblers which is how harmon allegedly referred to helix in his sales pitch to the underworld this is how the indictment summarizes harmons alleged first post about his service in june a pitch to convince criminals to pay him to hide their transactions from law enforcement before launching helix harmon posted online that helix was designed to be a bitcoin tumbler that cleans bitcoins by providing customers with new bitcoins which have never been to the darknet before harmon allegedly went on to promise that there was no way that law enforcement could tell which addresses are helix addresses given that the service uses new addresses for each transaction his alleged illscareyoucrooksintopaying followup advertising spiel no one has ever been arrested just through bitcoin taint but it is possible and do you want to be the first most markets use hot wallets they put all their fees in these wallets law enforcement just needs to check the taints on these wallets to find all the addresses a market uses in short taints are the trail left by bitcoins as they travel from wallet to wallet heres a discussion about traceability from stack exchange harmons helix bitcoin mixer allegedly moved at least bitcoin on behalf of customers a sum that was valued at over million at the time of the transactions and which is now worth about usd billion most of those customers came in from dark net markets helix had partnered with alphabay one of the largest dark net markets before law enforcement seized it in july to provide bitcoin laundering for alphabays customers harmons also been linked to grams a dark net search engine other dark net marketplaces that funneled funds to helix included agora market nucleus and dream market according to the indictment one of those bitcoin transfers led to harmons bust in november an fbi agent working undercover transferred bitcoin from an alphabay bitcoin wallet to helix the tumbler mixed it up and exchanged it for an equivalent amount of clean coins minus a fee of those new coins werent directly traceable to alphabay but that hasnt stopped law enforcement in the past in january for example researchers figured out how to unmask dark web markets buyers and sellers by forensically connecting them to bitcoin transactions threat hunting detection and response delivered by an expert team as a fullymanaged service learn more they didnt unmask many and granted those they did manage to identify made mistakes that were more common in the early less careful days of dealing in cryptocurrency they didnt hide transactions using bitcoin laundering services for example while some were none too scrupulous about using fake online identities that couldnt be traced to personally identifiable information pii helix isnt the first mixing service to go down in nonanonymous flames a string of mixing services have eventually figured out that bitcoin transactions arent fully anonymous thats why in july the biggest mixer of the day bitmixer abruptly shut down although bitmixers operator denied the connection at the time its closure came fast on the heels of the shutdowns of the alphabay and hansa dark markets the reason why bitmixer closed up shop it may have taken its operators a few years of operating but they finally realized that bitcoin doesnt have additional protections for pii by design not by omission bitmixers epiphany and shutdown came a week after google and blockchain analysis firm chainalysis which markets a tool called reactor to track and analyze the movement of bitcoin announced that they had managed to track ransomware payments paid in bitcoin from end to end some of those ransomware payments had been moved through bitcoin mixers that doesnt mean that all bitcoin mixer payments are done for illicit purposes mind you in fact chainalysis said in august that most mix transactions are done for additional privacy in spite of that was not a good time for mixers many of which like helix made their sales pitches directly to the solidly illicit crowd in fact bitmixer shut down three days after the doj shut down btce a fraudulent russian cryptocurrency exchange that was handling of all ransomware payments at the time and which itself relied on mixing services criminals seem to think that the dark net and cryptocurrency have a lot more opaque nooks and crannies than it does the fbi suggests heres a statement from special agent in charge timothy m dunham of the criminal division of the fbi washington field office the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency and the darknet may appeal to criminals as a refuge to hide their illicit activity however as harmons arrest demonstrates the fbi and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing the illegal practices of money launderers and other financial criminals to light and to justice regardless of whether they are using new
