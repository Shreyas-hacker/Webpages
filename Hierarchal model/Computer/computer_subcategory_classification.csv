menggunakan foto ataupun gambar saja yang mana itu adalah merupakan hal membosankan untuk bisa kita lihat di dalam handphone kita sehingga kita perlu pembaruan yang lebih menarik didalam handphone kita sehingga mata tidak bosan memandangnya untuk itu anda harus mencoba berbagai wallpaper yang bisa merubah wajah handphone anda salah satunya adalah dengan mengubah wallpaper yang foto atau animasinya bisa bergerak sehingga wallpaper handphone anda lebih berwarna dan lebih hidup bila kita memandangnya menggunakan wallpaper bergerak memang bukanlah suatu hal yang baru bila kita temukan di jaman sekarang ini wallpaper bergerak memang sudah marak terlihat sejak dahulu sehingga kita tak perlu heran lagi dengan kecanggihan tersebut akan tetapi memang masih sangat sedikit sekali yang menggunakan wallpaper dengan foto ataupun animasi yang bergerak seakan akan hidup di dalam handphonenya ada beberapa faktor yang mungkin mereka tidak menggunakan salah satunya adalah ketidak mengertian menggunakan wallpaper bergerak tersebut untuk itu kami ingin memberikan informasi bagi anda yang mempunyai niat untuk memakai wallpaper bergerak di handphone pribadi anda sehingga ponsel yang anda gunakan semakin menarik dan juga tidak membosankan bila anda melihatnya selain itu juga anda bisa bermain agen sbobet agar tidak bosan dalam aktifitas sehari hari tapi bukan berarti dengan menggunakan wallpaper bergerak seperti itu tidak memiliki kekurangannya wallpaper bergerak juga memiliki beberapa kekurangan salah satunya adalah mungkin bila anda memiliki handphone yang tidak memiliki spesifikasi yang memadai akan tetapi memakai wallpaper bergerak dampaknya adalah ponsel anda bisa menjadi lemot atau lelet jika anda gunakan karena beratnya wallpaper tersebut dan itu juga menjadi faktor mengapa pada saat ini masih jarang pengguna wallpaper bergerak pertama yang harus anda lakukan adalah mendownload dan instal aplikasi wallpaper hd di smartphone atau android anda kedua setelah anda berhasil menginstal aplikasi tersebut anda langsung bisa membukannya dan menginzinkan aplikasi tersebut mengakse foto anda di galeri ketiga setelah mengizinkan mengakses foto selesai anda maka anda akan di tampilkan seperti di bawah ini pastikan koneksi internet android sudah aktif tekan icon tambah pilih galeri masukan video yang ingin di jadikan wallpaper silahkan mencoba sudah pasti

android terbaik jadikan smartphone anda terlihat keren ada begitu banyak metode untuk membuat android anda terasa dan terlihat luar biasa namun salah satu yang pale nyaman adalah dengan mengunduh gaya android di bawah ini kami telah menyusun daftar periksa tentang apa yang kami yakini sebagai motif android terbaik untuk berbagai peluncur yang semuanya gratis untuk dipasang dan digunakan zenui adalah peluncur yang kuat untuk tema karena tidak memerlukan jenis bonus apa pun dan tidak dimuat dengan banyak bloatware meskipun temanya bukan yang pale teliti paket ikonnya biasanya mencakup hanya aplikasi yang pale mendasar dan juga sere tidak semua yang datang pra instal mereka tetap teratur ikon sea desire semuanya dibuat dengan mahir untuk menyatu dengan tema ikon untuk aplikasi olahpesan misalnya menyerupai pesan dalam botol simbol untuk aplikasi browser internet di sisi lain adalah radar ini hal yang menarik saya hanya berharap paket simbolnya jauh lebih luas pastikan untuk melihat motif fall juga suka tampilan sea dream dapatkan di play store glasklart memiliki banyak ikon berbeda bahkan untuk aplikasi yang sedikit lebih tipikal seperti anututu dan greenify dan tata letak umumnya sangat menakjubkan juga mereka yang tidak dibangun dari awal tidak berhati hati dari tempat di sini aplikasi dalam laci aplikasi seperti hantu ditarik dalam satu warna putih nama nama mereka sulit dilihat dibandingkan sejarah kelabu namun menarik mereka keluar dari kabinet aplikasi dan ke homescreen serta mereka terlihat indah simbol aplikasi diam diam tetapi diarsir secara ahli yang memberikan tampilan yang lembut dan mewah dengan ikon putih dan juga keperakan terhadap kombinasi ungu glasklart sangat disarankan smartphone yang memiliki spek menengah keatas akan sangat membantu anda dalam melakukan permainan judi online pada situs daftar judi bola karena permainan judi online yang dapat diakse melalui gadget membutuhkan spesifikasi smartphone yang mumpuni dan bagus putih

ikon aplikasi seperti kartu pos desain kartu nama ikon asisten pribadi digital khususnya yang mencuri program anda juga bisa mendapatkan banyak gaya untuk launcher pusat bervariasi dari norak hingga terbata menurut pendapat saya adegan musim dingin dua nada white yang tercantum di bawah ini adalah yang pale indah pinko sebenarnya telah menjadi fave android untuk jangka waktu yang lama berkat ikon minimalis dengan perhatian tinggi pada informasi pinko mengubah semua aplikasi anda menjadi lingkaran yang sebenarnya semuanya telah dirancang dan diwarnai dengan perawatan aplikasi dialer muncul seperti bagian mulut dari telepon kuno dan juga pesan dan semua simbol aplikasi hanyalah sekelompok lingkaran itu tidak membuat antarmuka pengguna terlihat jauh berbeda dan juga tidak menggunakan animasi yang mahal juga itu hanya menghasilkan gaya retro praktis yang terlihat lebih rapi dan jauh lebih inovatif daripada banyak tema pelengkap lainnya sejauh ini sebagian besar gaya pada daftar periksa kami sudah bersih dan minimalis namun ada di antara kita yang menyukai gaya keterlaluan sesekali terutama jika itu menarik tema cute rabit persis seperti itu aneh menyenangkan dan juga hidup

menjalankan android yang dibuat khusus motif setelah itu anda dapat memperoleh tema windows mobile dengan benar sini meskipun ada beberapa gaya hebat yang tersedia jika anda menginginkan sesuatu benar benar unik dan juga milik anda sendiri cara terbaik untuk mendapatkannya adalah dengan membuatnya kami juga harus menyebutkan bahwa salah satu peluncur yang pale disukai nova misalnya tidak memiliki dukungan tema sedangkan peluncur lain itu lakukan dapat memiliki iklan frustasi atau fitur tambahan yang tidak diinginkan jadi tema buatan sendiri tidak pernah merupakan konsep negatif bagaimana anda akan mengembangkannya cara termudah adalah menemukan wallpaper serta simbol dengan visual yang cocok saat ini itu cukup sederhana karena sebagian besar ikon ikon dibundel dengan wallpaper bertema namun demikian anda dapat menjelajahi aplikasi seperti muzei yang menyediakan wallpaper hidup atau tapet yang membuat wallpaper seorang favorit saya mengambil screenshot dari video game monument

that we decided to create cryptolinks a site that would help you make informed decisions cryptocurrency as well as its underlying technology is a nascent innovation with a plethora of technicalities that often evade experts let alone new entrants the same is true of the budding economy that propels the crypto market while many early adopters had relied on a trial and error method of picking the best of the few crypto solutions available back then the current state of the crypto space has however transcended such practice today participants must carry out comprehensive research to identify reliable crypto products as it has become more stressful and expensive to pick from the growing number of products finding their way into the crypto space hence the need for review platforms that would provide all the necessary resources to discover the disparities between the best cryptocurrency websites cryptolinks is an ongoing peoplecentric project that documents the efficacy of solutions

the cryptolinks team helmed by an experienced and motivated crypto enthusiast has put together a growing archive of top crypto sites arranged according to their crypto niche and the quality of services they avail and so the categories encompass the best cryptocurrency exchange sites top crypto aggregators best crypto apps reliable new websites and a host of other critical crypto sectors we left nothing to chance while compiling our best cryptocurrency website list in the crypto and blockchain scene knowing fully well that it is impossible to produce unbiased reviews without first getting a feel of the product we at cryptolinks have therefore decided to base our research on an experimental and organic approach for this project we adopted an organic analytic methodology which entailed the assessment of information garnered from the firsthand utilization of the products or cryptocurrency websites under review this methodology guarantees unfiltered information on the core functionalities of websites as opposed to the unreliable results often generated from the complete reliance on thirdparty publications apart from fixating on features we conducted background research on the teams backing the products subsequently we gauged crypto community feedback and assessed track records below are some of the criteria we almost always use to judge the competence and viability of crypto tools and websites user interface and design many believe that crypto technology is yet to achieve mainstream success because of its complex nature and so we expect every crypto developer and firm out there to use their platforms to debunk this notion by implementing easytouse crypto tools and features in other words one of the first things we check when analyzing the quality of crypto websites is their design and user experience cryptolinks ensures that it prioritizes websites which have done enough to simplify the processes involved in engaging with the crypto universe this task entails the careful analysis of the uxui of crypto websites and how easy it is for newbies to integrate utilize and navigate implemented features crypto fees other than user experience we focus on the pricing structure of the best cryptocurrency websites and handpick only those with competitive prices we are aware that a majority of the best cryptocurrency website have adopted subscription or commissionbased business models hence it only made sense that we explore the price disparities of the best cryptocurrency websites offering similar services to help readers make the correct decisions with the information made available in our review sections you can get unadulterated access to the fee frameworks of listed crypto sites to ascertain that you are getting a fair bargain crypto ads some cryptocurrency websites provide crypto services for free in some rare cases the website owners rely on contributions to keep their systems running conversely most owners decide to integrate ads to generate revenue in light of this we try as much as possible to ensure that the user experience of websites is at an optimum regardless of the revenuegenerating model used by crypto sites to achieve this we always check to see that the users or visitors do not have to navigate a barrage of ads before they access the information or tools they want for us the lower the number of advertisements found on a website the easier it is for users to enjoy its features thus we often rank websites with little or no ads higher reputation it is common knowledge that reputation is one of the vital criteria for determining the competence of crypto developers and website administrators therefore we have set out to explore the track records of crypto sites and unearth incidents that can give readers a clear indication of the proficiency of their preferred crypto brands here we certify that websites have over the years responded appropriately to challenges inherently common in the crypto terrain as such we only showcase sites with good track records and that are trusted in the crypto landscape however this does not mean that we completely marginalize new cryptocurrency websites innovation even though reputation is vital in our research methodology we do not let it sway us into settling for the best cryptocurrency websites with outdated infrastructures in contrast we make sure that innovation plays a vital role in our analysis and so we only highlight sites that have managed to maintain an innovative edge by creating new and potent paradigms in their crypto sector with this in mind we could not but help feature new promising sites loaded with impressive functionalities while new cryptocurrency websites lack the level of reputation synonymous with established brands they often feature on our lists because of the innovations they bring to the table security as you would expect security plays a pivotal role in our analysis users are always skeptical about subjecting their personal information funds and assets to thirdparty platforms especially when it involves cryptocurrency the precarious state of security in the crypto world has made it crucial for participants to investigate the security prowess of crypto entities before opting for their services as a result of this we carry out several security checks on each website featured on our review portal we ascertain that they utilize standard encryption protocols and implement effective identity verification systems security evaluations are particularly critical when reviewing platforms that impose kyc requirements or store crypto on behalf of their users customer support lastly we understand that many crypto website users are new to the terms governing crypto sites as well as their features and they will often require the help of representatives to navigate complex processes hence crypto sites must provide quality customer support systems to answer queries and resolve problems likewise these systems must possess the capacity to enable fast responses and transparent engagement for us at cryptolinks these are the minimum requirements in terms of customer relations for best cryptocurrency website thus our reviews always explore the customer support of cryptocurrency websites and ensure that they are versatile enough to meet the needs of users in record time i have also category of cryptocurrency websites that were among us through the cryptocurrency history so sites that had at one time or the other provided services and products to crypto participants but are no

coindesk market index coindesk market index features by jameson lopp apr at pm utc updated feb at pm utc from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledgers the cryptocurrency space is fast evolving to the point where it can be difficult to see in which direction its headed but were not without clues while many of the innovations in the space are new theyre built on decades of work that led to this point by tracing this history we can understand the motivations behind the movement that spawned bitcoin and share its vision for the future before the s cryptography was primarily practiced in secret by military or spy agencies but that changed when two publications brought it into the open the us government publication of the data encryption standard and the first publicly available work on publickey cryptography new directions in cryptography by dr whitfield diffie and dr martin hellman in the s dr david chaum wrote extensively on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems which he described in his paper security without identification transaction systems to make big brother obsolete over the next several years these ideas coalesced into a movement in late eric hughes timothy c may and john gilmore founded a small group that met monthly at gilmores company cygnus solutions in the san francisco bay area the group was humorously termed cypherpunks as a derivation of cipher and cyberpunk the cypherpunks mailing list was formed at about the same time and just a few months later eric hughes published a cypherpunks manifesto he wrote privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age privacy is not secrecy a private matter is something one doesnt want the whole world to know but a secret matter is something one doesnt want anybody to know privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world thats all good and well you may be thinking but im not a cypherpunk im not doing anything wrong i have nothing to hide as bruce schneier has noted the nothing to hide argument stems from a faulty premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong for example you likely have curtains over your windows so that people cant see into your home this isnt because you are undertaking illegal or immoral activities but simply because you dont wish to worry about the potential cost of revealing yourself to the outside world if youre reading this you have directly benefited from the efforts of cypherpunks some notable cypherpunks and their achievements jacob appelbaum tor developer julian assange founder of wikileaks dr adam back inventor of hashcash cofounder of blockstream bram cohen creator of bittorrent hal finney main author of pgp creator of reusable proof of work tim hudson coauthor of ssleay the precursor to openssl paul kocher coauthor of ssl moxie marlinspike founder of open whisper systems developer of signal steven schear creator of the concept of the warrant canary bruce schneier wellknown security author zooko wilcoxohearn digicash developer founder of zcash philip zimmermann creator of pgp this decade saw the rise of the crypto wars in which the us government attempted to stifle the spread of strong commercial encryption since the market for cryptography was almost entirely military up to this point encryption technology was included as a category xiii item into the us munitions list which had strict regulations preventing its export this limited export compatible ssl key length to bits which could be broken in a matter of days using a single personal computer legal challenges by civil libertarians and privacy advocates the widespread availability of encryption software outside the us and a successful attack by matt blaze against the governments proposed backdoor the clipper chip led the government to back down in dr adam back created hashcash which was designed as an antispam mechanism that would essentially add a time and computational cost to sending email thus making spam uneconomical he envisioned that hashcash would be easier for people to use than chaums digicash since there was no need for the creation of an account hashcash even had some protection against double spending later in  wei dai published a proposal for bmoney a practical way to enforce contractual agreements between anonymous actors he described two interesting concepts that should sound familiar first a protocol in which every participant maintains a separate database of how much money belongs to user secondly a variant of the first system where the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants who are incentivized to remain honest by putting their money on the line bitcoin uses the former concept while quite a few other cryptocurrencies have implemented a variant of the latter concept which we now call proof of stake its clear that cypherpunks had already been building on each others work for decades experimenting and laying the frameworks we needed in the s but a pivotal point was the creation of cypherpunk money in the s in hal finney created reusable proof of work rpow which built on backs hashcash rpows were unique cryptographic tokens that could only be used once much like unspent transaction outputs in bitcoin however validation and protection against double spending was still performed by a central server nick szabo published a proposal for bit gold in a digital collectible that built upon finneys rpow proposal however szabo did not propose a mechanism for limiting the total units of bit gold but rather envisioned that units would be valued differently based upon the amount of computational work performed to create them finally in satoshi nakamoto a pseudonym for a stillunidentified individual or individuals published the bitcoin whitepaper citing both hashcash and bmoney in fact satoshi emailed wei dai directly and mentioned that he learned about bmoney from dr back satoshi dedicated a section of the bitcoin whitepaper to privacy which reads the traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party the necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place by keeping public keys anonymous the public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else but without information linking the transaction to anyone this is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges where the time and size of individual trades the tape is made public but without telling who the parties were satoshi nakamoto triggered an avalanche of progress with a working system that people could use extend and fork bitcoin strengthened the entire cypherpunk movement by enabling organizations such as wikileaks to continue operating via bitcoin donations even after the traditional financial system had cut them off however as the bitcoin ecosystem has grown over the past few years privacy concerns seem to have been pushed to the backburner many early bitcoin users assumed that the system would give them complete anonymity but we have learned otherwise as various law enforcement agencies have revealed that they are able to deanonymize bitcoin users during investigations the open bitcoin privacy project has picked up some of the slack with regard to educating users about privacy and recommending best practices for bitcoin services the group is developing a threat model for attacks on bitcoin wallet privacy their model currently breaks attackers into several categories blockchain observers link different transactions together to the same identity by observing patterns in the flow of value network observers link different transactions and addresses together by observing activity on the peer to peer network physical adversaries try to find data on a wallet device in order to tamper with it or perform analysis upon it transaction participants create transactions that aid them in tracing and deanonymizing activity on the blockchain wallet providers may require personally identifiable information from users and then observe their transactions jonas nick at blockstream has also done a fair amount of research regarding privacy concerns for bitcoin users he has an excellent presentation in which he uncovers a number of privacy flaws some of which are devastating to spv bitcoin clients one of the greatest privacy issues in bitcoin is from blockchain observers because every transaction on the network is indefinitely public anyone in the present and future can be a potential adversary as a result one of the oldest recommended best practices is to never reuse a bitcoin address satoshi even made note of it in the bitcoin whitepaper as an additional firewall a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner some linking is still unavoidable with multiinput transactions which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner the risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner a multitude of systems and best practices have been developed in order to increase the privacy of bitcoin users dr pieter wuille authored bip hierarchical deterministic hd wallets which makes it much simpler for bitcoin wallets to manage addresses while privacy was not wuilles primary motivation hd wallets make it easier to avoid address reuse because the tech can easily generate new addresses as transactions flow into and out of the wallet elliptic curve diffiehellmanmerkle ecdhm addresses are bitcoin address schemes that increase privacy ecdhm addresses can be shared publicly and are used by senders and receivers to secretly derive traditional bitcoin addresses that blockchain observers cannot predict the result is that ecdhm addresses can be reused without the loss of privacy that usually occurs from traditional bitcoin address reuse some examples of ecdhm address schemes include stealth addresses by peter todd bip reusable payment codes by justus ranvier and bip out of band address exchange by justin newton and others bitcoin mixing is a more labor intensive method by which users can increase their privacy the concept of mixing coins with other participants is similar to the concept of mix networks invented by dr chaum several different mixing algorithms have been developed coinjoin blockstream cofounder gregory maxwells original proposal for mixing coins coinjoin essentially lets users create a transaction with many inputs from multiple people and then send the coins to many other outputs that pay back to the same people thus mixing the values together and making it difficult to tell which inputs are related to which outputs caption id alignaligncenter width example of a naïve coinjoin transactioncaption joinmarket built by developer chris belcher joinmarket enables holders of bitcoin to allow their coins to be mixed via coinjoin with other users coins in return for a fee it uses a kind of smart contract so that your private keys never leave your computer thus reducing the risk of loss put simply joinmarket allows you to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions for low fees in a decentralized fashion coinshuffle a decentralized mixing protocol developed by a group of researchers at saarland university in germany coinshuffle improves upon coinjoin it does not require a trusted third party to assemble the mixing transactions and thus does not require additional mixing fees coinswap another concept developed by maxwell coinswap is substantially different from coinjoin in that it uses a series of four multisig transactions two escrow payments two escrow releases to trustlessly swap coins between two parties it is much less efficient than coinjoin but can potentially offer much greater privacy even facilitating the swapping of coins between different blockchains while mixing is tantamount to hiding in a crowd often the crowd is not particularly large mixing should be considered as providing obfuscation rather than complete anonymity because it makes it difficult for casual observers to trace the flow of funds but more sophisticated observers may still be able to deobfuscate the mixing transactions kristov atlas founder of the open bitcoin privacy project posted his findings on weaknesses in improperly implemented coinjoin clients back in atlas noted that even with a fairly primitive analysis tool he was able to group of inputs and of a single coinjoin transactions outputs there are even separate cryptocurrencies that have been developed with privacy in mind one example is dash designed by evan duffield and daniel diaz which has a feature called darksend   an improved version of coinjoin the two major improvements are the value amounts used and frequency of mixing dashs mixing uses common denominations of dash dash dash and dash in order to make grouping of inputs and outputs much more difficult in each mixing session users submit the same denominations as inputs and outputs to maximize the privacy offered by mixing and make timing attacks more difficult darksend runs automatically at set intervals another privacyfocused cryptocurrency is not even based on bitcoin the cryptonote whitepaper was released in by nicolas van saberhagen and the concept has been implemented in several cryptocurrencies such as monero the primary innovations are cryptographic ring signatures and unique onetime keys regular digital signatures such as those used in bitcoin involve a single pair of keys one public and one private this allows the owner of a public address to prove that they own it by signing a spend of funds with the corresponding private key screen shot at pm ring signatures were first proposed in httpdownloadspringercomstaticpdfchpaf_pdforiginurlhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_tokenexpaclfstaticfpdfffchpaf_pdfforiginurldhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_hmacceddecafefcaabfbfbeafcecda by dr adi

httpdownloadspringercomstaticpdfchpaf_pdforiginurlhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_tokenexpaclfstaticfpdfffchpaf_pdfforiginurldhttpafflinkspringercomfchapterff_hmacceaddddaefaffbafcbaffecac by dr chaum and eugene van heyst ring signatures involve a group of individuals each with their own private and public key the statement proved by a ring signature is that the signer of a given message is a member of the group the main distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes is that the signer needs a single secret key but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of the signer therefore if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys of alice bob and carol you can only claim that one of these individuals was the signer but you will not be able to know exactly to whom the transaction belongs it provides another level of obfuscation that makes it more difficult for blockchain observers to track the ownership of payments as they flow through the system interesting enough ring signatures were developed specifically in the context of whistleblowing as they enable the anonymous leaking of secrets while still proving that the source of the secrets is reputable an individual who is part of a known group cryptonote is also designed to mitigate the risks associated with key reuse and inputtooutput tracing every address for a payment is a unique onetime key derived from both the senders and the recipients data as soon as you use a ring signature in your input it adds more uncertainty as to which output has just been spent if a blockchain observer tries to draw a graph with used addresses connecting them via the transactions on the blockchain it will be a tree because no address was used twice the number of possible graphs rises exponentially as you add more transactions to the graph since every ring signature produces ambiguity as to how the value flowed between the addresses thus you cant be certain of which address sent funds to another address depending on the size of the ring used for signing the ambiguity for a single transaction can vary from one out of two to one out of every transaction increases the entropy and creates additional difficulty for a blockchain observer while there are still many privacy concerns for cryptocurrency users the future is bright due to the ongoing work of cypherpunks the next leap forward in privacy will involve the use of zeroknowledge proofs which were first proposed in in order to broaden the potential applications of cryptographic protocols originally proposed by dr back in as bitcoins with homomorphic value maxwell has been working on confidential transactions which use zeroknowledge range proofs to enable the creation of bitcoin transactions in which the values are hidden from everyone except the transaction participants this is a great improvement on its own but when you combine confidential transactions with coinjoin then you can build a mixing service that severs any links between transaction inputs and outputs when maxwell presented sidechain elements at the san francisco bitcoin devs meetup i recall him saying one of the greatest regrets held by the greybeards at the ietf is that the internet was not built with encryption as the default method of transmitting data maxwell clearly feels the same way about privacy in bitcoin and wishes that we had confidential transactions from the very beginning we have already seen blockstream implement confidential transactions within the liquid sidechain in order to mask transfers between exchanges we also recently saw maxwell conduct the first successful zeroknowledge contingent payment on the bitcoin network zkcp is a transaction protocol that allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using bitcoin in a trustless manner the purchased information is only transferred if the payment is made and it is guaranteed to be transferred if the payment is made the buyer and seller do not need to trust each other or depend on arbitration by a third party i wrote about zerocoin several years ago and noted the technical challenges that it needed to overcome before the system could be useable since then researchers have managed to make the proofs much more efficient and have solved the trust problem with the initial generation of the system parameters we are now on the cusp of seeing zerocoins vision realized with the release of zcash headed by wilcoxohearn zcash offers total payment confidentiality while still maintaining a decentralized network using a public blockchain zcash transactions automatically hide the sender recipient and value of all transactions on the blockchain only those with the correct view key can see the contents of a transaction since the contents of zcash transactions are encrypted and private the system uses a novel cryptographic method to verify payments zcash uses a zeroknowledge proof construction called a zksnark developed by its team of experienced cryptographers instead of publicly demonstrating spendauthority and transaction values the transaction metadata is encrypted and zksnarks are used to prove that the transaction is valid zcash may very well be the first digital payment system that enables foolproof anonymity in the decades since the cypherpunks set forth on their quest computer technology has advanced to the point where individuals and groups can communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner two persons may exchange messages conduct business and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name or legal identity of the other it is only natural that governments will try to slow or halt the spread of this technology citing national security concerns use of the technology by criminals and fears of societal disintegration cypherpunks know that we must defend our privacy if we expect to have any people have been defending their privacy for centuries with whispers darkness envelopes closed doors secret handshakes and couriers prior to the th century technology did not enable strong privacy but neither did it enable affordable mass surveillance we now live in a world where surveillance is to be expected but privacy is not even though privacy enhancing technologies exist we have entered a phase that many are calling the crypto wars although the cypherpunks emerged victorious from the first crypto wars we cannot afford to rest upon our laurels zooko has experienced the failure of cypherpunk projects in the past and he warns httpsepicenterbitcoincompodcast that failure is still possible cypherpunks believe that privacy is a fundamental human right including privacy from governments they understand that the weakening of a systems security for any reason including access by trusted authorities makes the system insecure for everyone who uses it cypherpunks write code they know that someone has to write software to defend privacy and thus they take up the task they publish their code so that fellow cypherpunks may learn from it attack it and improve upon it their code is free for anyone to use cypherpunks dont care if you dont approve of the software they write they know that software cant be destroyed and that widely dispersed systems cant be shut down thanks to kristov atlas and jonas nick for reviewing and

wikidata item printexport download as pdf printable version from wikipedia the free encyclopedia history of bitcoin a cryptocurrency number of bitcoin transactions per month logarithmic scale bitcoin is a cryptocurrency a digital asset that uses cryptography to control its creation and management rather than relying on central authorities originally designed as a medium of exchange bitcoin is now primarily regarded as a store of value the history of bitcoin started with its invention and implementation by satoshi nakamoto who integrated many existing ideas from the cryptography community over the course of bitcoins history it has undergone rapid growth to become a significant store of value both on and offline from the mids some businesses began accepting bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies background edit prior to the release of bitcoin there were a number of digital cash technologies starting with the issuerbased ecash protocols of david chaum and stefan brands the idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers cynthia dwork and moni naor in the idea was independently rediscovered by adam back who developed hashcash a proofofwork scheme for spam control in the first proposals for distributed digital scarcitybased cryptocurrencies were wei dai s bmoney and nick szabo s bit gold hal finney developed reusable proof of work rpow using hashcash as its proof of work algorithm in the bit gold proposal which proposed a collectible marketbased mechanism for inflation control nick szabo also investigated some additional aspects including a byzantine faulttolerant agreement protocol based on quorum addresses to store and transfer the chained proofofwork solutions which was vulnerable to sybil attacks though can bitcoin profitable for now  creation edit on the th of august the domain name bitcoinorg was registered later that year on october a link to a paper authored by satoshi nakamoto titled bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system was posted to a cryptography mailing list this paper detailed methods of using a peertopeer network to generate what was described as a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust on january the bitcoin network came into existence with satoshi nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin block number which had a reward of bitcoins embedded in the genesis block was the text the times jan chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks the text refers to a headline in the times published on january this note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractionalreserve banking   the first open source bitcoin client was released on january hosted at sourceforge one of the first supporters adopters contributors to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer hal finney finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released and received bitcoins from nakamoto in the worlds first bitcoin transaction on january bloc other early supporters were wei dai creator of bitcoin predecessor bmoney and nick szabo creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold in the early days nakamoto is estimated to have mined million bitcoins before disappearing from any involvement in bitcoin nakamoto in a sense handed over the reins to developer gavin andresen who then became the bitcoin lead developer at the bitcoin foundation the anarchic bitcoin communitys closest thing to an official public face satoshi nakamoto edit main article satoshi nakamoto satoshi nakamoto is presumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in and launched the network in nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the bitcoin forum there has been much speculation as to the identity of satoshi nakamoto with suspects including dai szabo and finney  and accompanying denials the possibility that satoshi nakamoto was a computer collective in the european financial sector has also been discussed investigations into the real identity of satoshi nakamoto were attempted by the new yorker and fast company the new yorkers investigation brought up at least two possible candidates michael clear and vili lehdonvirta fast company s investigation brought up circumstantial evidence linking an encryption patent application filed by neal king vladimir oksman and charles bry on august and the bitcoinorg domain name which was registered  hours later the patent application contained networking and encryption technologies similar to bitcoins and textual analysis revealed that the phrase  computationally impractical to reverse appeared in both the patent application and bitcoins whitepaper all three inventors explicitly denied being satoshi nakamoto in may ted nelson speculated that japanese mathematician shinichi mochizuki is satoshi nakamoto later in the israeli researchers dorit ron and adi shamir pointed to silk roadlinked ross william ulbricht as the possible person behind the cover the two researchers based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions these allegations were contested and ron and shamir later retracted their claim nakamotos involvement with bitcoin does not appear to extend past mid in april nakamoto communicated with a bitcoin contributor saying that he had moved on to other things stefan thomas a swiss coder and active community member graphed the time stamps for each of nakamotos plus bitcoin forum posts the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of  am and  am greenwich mean time because this pattern held true even on saturdays and sundays it suggested that nakamoto was asleep at this time and the hours of  am to  am gmt are midnight to  am eastern standard time north american eastern standard time other clues suggested that nakamoto was british a newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the ukpublished newspaper the times and both his forum

and list of bitcoin forks a fork referring to a blockchain is defined variously as a blockchain split into two paths forward or as a change of protocol rules accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process they happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time as a result the network briefly forks this fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain that were dropped by the longer chain march edit on march a bitcoin miner running version of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions this created a split or fork in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block this split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain in response the mt gox exchange temporarily halted bitcoin deposits the exchange rate fell to on the mt gox exchange but rose most of the way back to its prior level of

states department of the treasury issued a report regarding centralized and decentralized virtual currencies and their legal status within money services business msb and bank secrecy act regulations it classified digital currencies and other digital payment systems such as bitcoin as virtual currencies because they are not legal tender under any sovereign jurisdiction fincen cleared american users of bitcoin of legal obligations by saying a user of virtual currency is not an msb under fincens regulations and therefore is not subject to msb registration reporting and recordkeeping regulations however it held that american entities who generate virtual currency such as bitcoins are money transmitters or msbs if they sell their generated currency for national currency a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter this specifically extends to miners of the bitcoin currency who may have to register as msbs and abide by the legal requirements of being a money transmitter if they sell their generated bitcoins for national currency and are within the united states since fincen issued this guidance dozens of virtual currency exchangers and administrators have registered with fincen and fincen is receiving an increasing number of suspicious activity reports sars from these entities additionally fincen claimed regulation over american entities that manage bitcoins in a payment processor setting or as an exchanger in addition a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such decentralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency funds or other value that substitutes for currency in summary fincens decision would require bitcoin exchanges where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies to disclose large transactions and suspicious activity comply with money laundering regulations and collect information about their customers as traditional financial institutions are required to do jennifer shasky calvery the director of fincen said virtual currencies are subject to the same rules as other currencies basic moneyservices business rules apply here in its october

https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/,how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddihow the bitcoin protocol actually works first steps a signed letter of intent using serial numbers to make coins uniquely identifiable making everyone collectively the bank proofofwork problems for the author bitcoin transactions with multiple inputs and outputs conclusion footnote comments post navigationskip to content ddi datadriven intelligence many thousands of articles have been written purporting to explain bitcoin the online peertopeer currency most of those articles give a handwavy account of the underlying cryptographic protocol omitting many details even those articles which delve deeper often gloss over crucial points my aim in this post is to explain the major ideas behind the bitcoin protocol in a clear easily comprehensible way well start from first principles build up to a broad theoretical understanding of how the protocol works and then dig down into the nittygritty examining the raw data in a bitcoin transaction understanding the protocol in this detailed way is hard work it is tempting instead to take bitcoin as given and to engage in speculation about how to get rich with bitcoin whether bitcoin is a bubble whether bitcoin might one day mean the end of taxation and so on thats fun but severely limits your understanding understanding the details of the bitcoin protocol opens up otherwise inaccessible vistas in particular its the basis for understanding bitcoins builtin scripting language which makes it possible to use bitcoin to create new types of financial instruments such as smart contracts new financial instruments can in turn be used to create new markets and to enable new forms of collective human behaviour talk about fun ill describe bitcoin scripting and concepts such as smart contracts in future posts this post concentrates on explaining the nutsandbolts of the bitcoin protocol to understand the post you need to be comfortable with public key cryptography and with the closely related idea of digital signatures ill also assume youre familiar with cryptographic hashing none of this is especially difficult the basic ideas can be taught in freshman university mathematics or computer science classes the ideas are beautiful so if youre not familiar with them i recommend taking a few hours to get familiar it may seem surprising that bitcoins basis is cryptography isnt bitcoin a currency not a way of sending secret messages in fact the problems bitcoin needs to solve are largely about securing transactions making sure people cant steal from one another or impersonate one another and so on in the world of atoms we achieve security with devices such as locks safes signatures and bank vaults in the world of bits we achieve this kind of security with cryptography and thats why bitcoin is at heart a cryptographic protocol my strategy in the post is to build bitcoin up in stages ill begin by explaining a very simple digital currency based on ideas that are almost obvious well call that currency infocoin to distinguish it from bitcoin of course our first version of infocoin will have many deficiencies and so well go through several iterations of infocoin with each iteration introducing just one or two simple new ideas after several such iterations well arrive at the full bitcoin protocol we will have reinvented bitcoin this strategy is slower than if i explained the entire bitcoin protocol in one shot but while you can understand the mechanics of bitcoin through such a oneshot explanation it would be difficult to understand why bitcoin is designed the way it is the advantage of the slower iterative explanation is that it gives us a much sharper understanding of each element of bitcoin finally i should mention that im a relative newcomer to bitcoin ive been following it loosely since and cryptocurrencies since the late s but only got seriously into the details of the bitcoin protocol earlier this year so id certainly appreciate corrections of any misapprehensions on my part also in the post ive included a number of problems for the author notes to myself about questions that came up during the writing you may find these interesting but you can also skip them entirely without losing track of the main text so how can we design a digital currency on the face of it a digital currency sounds impossible suppose some person lets call her alice has some digital money which she wants to spend if alice can use a string of bits as money how can we prevent her from using the same bit string over and over thus minting an infinite supply of money or if we can somehow solve that problem how can we prevent someone else forging such a string of bits and using that to steal from alice these are just two of the many problems that must be overcome in order to use information as money as a first version of infocoin lets find a way that alice can use a string of bits as a very primitive and incomplete form of money in a way that gives her at least some protection against forgery suppose alice wants to give another person bob an infocoin to do this alice writes down the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin she then digitally signs the message using a private cryptographic key and announces the signed string of bits to the entire world by the way im using capitalized infocoin to refer to the protocol and general concept and lowercase infocoin to refer to specific denominations of the currency a similar useage is common though not universal in the bitcoin world this isnt terribly impressive as a prototype digital currency but it does have some virtues anyone in the world including bob can use alices public key to verify that alice really was the person who signed the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin noone else could have created that bit string and so alice cant turn around and say no i didnt mean to give bob an infocoin so the protocol establishes that alice truly intends to give bob one infocoin the same fact noone else could compose such a signed message also gives alice some limited protection from forgery of course after alice has published her message its possible for other people to duplicate the message so in that sense forgery is possible but its not possible from scratch these two properties establishment of intent on alices part and the limited protection from forgery are genuinely notable features of this protocol i havent quite said exactly what digital money is in this protocol to make this explicit its just the message itself ie the string of bits representing the digitally signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin later protocols will be similar in that all our forms of digital money will be just more and more elaborate messages a problem with the first version of infocoin is that alice could keep sending bob the same signed message over and over suppose bob receives ten copies of the signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin does that mean alice sent bob ten different infocoins was her message accidentally duplicated perhaps she was trying to trick bob into believing that she had given him ten different infocoins when the message only proves to the world that she intends to transfer one infocoin what wed like is a way of making infocoins unique they need a label or serial number alice would sign the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number then later alice could sign the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and bob and everyone else would know that a different infocoin was being transferred to make this scheme work we need a trusted source of serial numbers for the infocoins one way to create such a source is to introduce a bank this bank would provide serial numbers for infocoins keep track of who has which infocoins and verify that transactions really are legitimate in more detail lets suppose alice goes into the bank and says i want to withdraw one infocoin from my account the bank reduces her account balance by one infocoin and assigns her a new neverbefore used serial number lets say then when alice wants to transfer her infocoin to bob she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number but bob doesnt just accept the infocoin instead he contacts the bank and verifies that a the infocoin with that serial number belongs to alice and b alice hasnt already spent the infocoin if both those things are true then bob tells the bank he wants to accept the infocoin and the bank updates their records to show that the infocoin with that serial number is now in bobs possession and no longer belongs to alice this last solution looks pretty promising however it turns out that we can do something much more ambitious we can eliminate the bank entirely from the protocol this changes the nature of the currency considerably it means that there is no longer any single organization in charge of the currency and when you think about the enormous power a central bank has control over the money supply thats a pretty huge change the idea is to make it so everyone collectively is the bank in particular well assume that everyone using infocoin keeps a complete record of which infocoins belong to which person you can think of this as a shared public ledger showing all infocoin transactions well call this ledger the block chain since thats what the complete record will be called in bitcoin once we get to it now suppose alice wants to transfer an infocoin to bob she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and gives the signed message to bob bob can use his copy of the block chain to check that indeed the infocoin is alices to give if that checks out then he broadcasts both alices message and his acceptance of the transaction to the entire network and everyone updates their copy of the block chain we still have the where do serial number come from problem but that turns out to be pretty easy to solve and so i will defer it to later in the discussion of bitcoin a more challenging problem is that this protocol allows alice to cheat by double spending her infocoin she sends the signed message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number to bob and the messagei alice am giving charlie one infocoin with the same serial number to charlie both bob and charlie use their copy of the block chain to verify that the infocoin is alices to spend provided they do this verification at nearly the same time before theyve had a chance to hear from one another both will find that yes the block chain shows the coin belongs to alice and so they will both accept the transaction and also broadcast their acceptance of the transaction now theres a problem how should other people update their block chains there may be no easy way to achieve a consistent shared ledger of transactions and even if everyone can agree on a consistent way to update their block chains there is still the problem that either bob or charlie will be cheated at first glance double spending seems difficult for alice to pull off after all if alice sends the message first to bob then bob can verify the message and tell everyone else in the network including charlie to update their block chain once that has happened charlie would no longer be fooled by alice so there is most likely only a brief period of time in which alice can double spend however its obviously undesirable to have any such a period of time worse there are techniques alice could use to make that period longer she could for example use network traffic analysis to find times when bob and charlie are likely to have a lot of latency in communication or perhaps she could do something to deliberately disrupt their communications if she can slow communication even a little that makes her task of double spending much easier how can we address the problem of double spending the obvious solution is that when alice sends bob an infocoin bob shouldnt try to verify the transaction alone rather he should broadcast the possible transaction to the entire network of infocoin users and ask them to help determine whether the transaction is legitimate if they collectively decide that the transaction is okay then bob can accept the infocoin and everyone will update their block chain this type of protocol can help prevent double spending since if alice tries to spend her infocoin with both bob and charlie other people on the network will notice and network users will tell both bob and charlie that there is a problem with the transaction and the transaction shouldnt go through in more detail lets suppose alice wants to give bob an infocoin as before she signs the message i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number and gives the signed message to bob also as before bob does a sanity check using his copy of the block chain to check that indeed the coin currently belongs to alice but at that point the protocol is modified bob doesnt just go ahead and accept the transaction instead he broadcasts alices message to the entire network other members of the network check to see whether alice owns that infocoin if so they broadcast the message yes alice owns infocoin it can now be transferred to bob once enough people have broadcast that message everyone updates their block chain to show that infocoin now belongs to bob and the transaction is complete this protocol has many imprecise elements at present for instance what does it mean to say once enough people have broadcast that message what exactly does enough mean here it cant mean everyone in the network since we dont a priori know who is on the infocoin network for the same reason it cant mean some fixed fraction of users in the network we wont try to make these ideas precise right now instead in the next section ill point out a serious problem with the approach as described fixing that problem will at the same time have the pleasant side effect of making the ideas above much more precise suppose alice wants to double spend in the networkbased protocol i just described she could do this by taking over the infocoin network lets suppose she uses an automated system to set up a large number of separate identities lets say a billion on the infocoin network as before she tries to double spend the same infocoin with both bob and charlie but when bob and charlie ask the network to validate their respective transactions alices sock puppet identities swamp the network announcing to bob that theyve validated his transaction and to charlie that theyve validated his transaction possibly fooling one or both into accepting the transaction theres a clever way of avoiding this problem using an idea known as proofofwork the idea is counterintuitive and involves a combination of two ideas to artificially make it computationally costly for network users to validate transactions and to reward them for trying to help validate transactions the reward is used so that people on the network will try to help validate transactions even though thats now been made a computationally costly process the benefit of making it costly to validate transactions is that validation can no longer be influenced by the number of network identities someone controls but only by the total computational power they can bring to bear on validation as well see with some clever design we can make it so a cheater would need enormous computational resources to cheat making it impractical thats the gist of proofofwork but to really understand proofofwork we need to go through the details suppose alice broadcasts to the network the news that i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number as other people on the network hear that message each adds it to a queue of pending transactions that theyve been told about but which havent yet been approved by the network for instance another network user named david might have the following queue of pending transactions i tom am giving sue one infocoin with serial number i sydney am giving cynthia one infocoin with serial number i alice am giving bob one infocoin with serial number david checks his copy of the block chain and can see that each transaction is valid he would like to help out by broadcasting news of that validity to the entire network however before doing that as part of the validation protocol david is required to solve a hard computational puzzle the proofofwork without the solution to that puzzle the rest of the network wont accept his validation of the transaction what puzzle does david need to solve to explain that let be a fixed hash function known by everyone in the network its built into the protocol bitcoin uses the wellknown sha hash function but any cryptographically secure hash function will do lets give davids queue of pending transactions a label just so its got a name we can refer to suppose david appends a number called the nonce to and hashes the combination for example if we use hello world obviously this is not a list of transactions just a string used for illustrative purposes and the nonce then output is in hexadecimal hhello world afcfdaadceecaaceceecc the puzzle david has to solve the proofofwork is to find a nonce such that when we append to and hash the combination the output hash begins with a long run of zeroes the puzzle can be made more or less difficult by varying the number of zeroes required to solve the puzzle a relatively simple proofofwork puzzle might require just three or four zeroes at the start of the hash while a more difficult proofofwork puzzle might require a much longer run of zeros say consecutive zeroes in either case the above attempt to find a suitable nonce with is a failure since the output doesnt begin with any zeroes at all trying doesnt work either hhello world eafcbefabdcdadeeefbeeaad we can keep trying different values for the nonce finally at we obtain hhello world caffcffdcfaffadfcceaedcde this nonce gives us a string of four zeroes at the beginning of the output of the hash this will be enough to solve a simple proofofwork puzzle but not enough to solve a more difficult proofofwork puzzle what makes this puzzle hard to solve is the fact that the output from a cryptographic hash function behaves like a random number change the input even a tiny bit and the output from the hash function changes completely in a way thats hard to predict so if we want the output hash value to begin with zeroes say then david will need on average to try different values for before he finds a suitable nonce thats a pretty challenging task requiring lots of computational power obviously its possible to make this puzzle more or less difficult to solve by requiring more or fewer zeroes in the output from the hash function in fact the bitcoin protocol gets quite a fine level of control over the difficulty of the puzzle by using a slight variation on the proofofwork puzzle described above instead of requiring leading zeroes the bitcoin proofofwork puzzle requires the hash of a blocks header to be lower than or equal to a number known as the target this target is automatically adjusted to ensure that a bitcoin block takes on average about ten minutes to validate in practice there is a sizeable randomness in how long it takes to validate a block sometimes a new block is validated in just a minute or two other times it may take minutes or even longer its straightforward to modify the bitcoin protocol so that the time to validation is much more sharply peaked around ten minutes instead of solving a single puzzle we can require that multiple puzzles be solved with some careful design it is possible to considerably reduce the variance in the time to validate a block of transactions alright lets suppose david is lucky and finds a suitable nonce celebration hell be rewarded for finding the nonce as described below he broadcasts the block of transactions hes approving to the network together with the value for other participants in the infocoin network can verify that is a valid solution to the proofofwork puzzle and they then update their block chains to include the new block of transactions for the proofofwork idea to have any chance of succeeding network users need an incentive to help validate transactions without such an incentive they have no reason to expend valuable computational power merely to help validate other peoples transactions and if network users are not willing to expend that power then the whole system wont work the solution to this problem is to reward people who help validate transactions in particular suppose we reward whoever successfully validates a block of transactions by crediting them with some infocoins provided the infocoin reward is large enough that will give them an incentive to participate in validation in the bitcoin protocol this validation process is called mining for each block of transactions validated the successful miner receives a bitcoin reward initially this was set to be a bitcoin reward but for every validated blocks roughly once every four years the reward halves this has happened just once to date and so the current reward for mining a block is bitcoins this halving in the rate will continue every four years until the year ce at that point the reward for mining will drop below bitcoins per block bitcoins is actually the minimal unit of bitcoin and is known as a satoshi so in ce the total supply of bitcoins will cease to increase however that wont eliminate the incentive to help validate transactions bitcoin also makes it possible to set aside some currency in a transaction as a transaction fee which goes to the miner who helps validate it in the early days of bitcoin transaction fees were mostly set to zero but as bitcoin has gained in popularity transaction fees have gradually risen and are now a substantial additional incentive on top of the bitcoin reward for mining a block you can think of proofofwork as a competition to approve transactions each entry in the competition costs a little bit of computing power a miners chance of winning the competition is roughly and with some caveats equal to the proportion of the total computing power that they control so for instance if a miner controls one percent of the computing power being used to validate bitcoin transactions then they have roughly a one percent chance of winning the competition so provided a lot of computing power is being brought to bear on the competition a dishonest miner is likely to have only a relatively small chance to corrupt the validation process unless they expend a huge amount of computing resources of course while its encouraging that a dishonest party has only a relatively small chance to corrupt the block chain thats not enough to give us confidence in the currency in particular we havent yet conclusively addressed the issue of double spending ill analyse double spending shortly before doing that i want to fill in an important detail in the description of infocoin wed ideally like the infocoin network to agree upon the order in which transactions have occurred if we dont have such an ordering then at any given moment it may not be clear who owns which infocoins to help do this well require that new blocks always include a pointer to the last block validated in the chain in addition to the list of transactions in the block the pointer is actually just a hash of the previous block so typically the block chain is just a linear chain of blocks of transactions one after the other with later blocks each containing a pointer to the immediately prior block occasionally a fork will appear in the block chain this can happen for instance if by chance two miners happen to validate a block of transactions nearsimultaneously both broadcast their newlyvalidated block out to the network and some people update their block chain one way and others update their block chain the other way this causes exactly the problem were trying to avoid its no longer clear in what order transactions have occurred and it may not be clear who owns which infocoins fortunately theres a simple idea that can be used to remove any forks the rule is this if a fork occurs people on the network keep track of both forks but at any given time miners only work to extend whichever fork is longest in their copy of the block chain suppose for example that we have a fork in which some miners receive block a first and some miners receive block b first those miners who receive block a first will continue mining along that fork while the others will mine along fork b lets suppose that the miners working on fork b are the next to successfully mine a block after they receive news that this has happened the miners working on fork a will notice that fork b is now longer and will switch to working on that fork presto in short order work on fork a will cease and everyone will be working on the same linear chain and block a can be ignored of course any stillpending transactions in a will still be pending in the queues of the miners working on fork b and so all transactions will eventually be validated likewise it may be that the miners working on fork a are the first to extend their fork in that case work on fork b will quickly cease and again we have a single linear chain no matter what the outcome this process ensures that the block chain has an agreedupon time ordering of the blocks in bitcoin proper a transaction is not considered confirmed until it is part of a block in the longest fork and at least blocks follow it in the longest fork in this case we say that the transaction has confirmations this gives the network time to come to an agreedupon the ordering of the blocks well also use this strategy for infocoin with the timeordering now understood lets return to think about what happens if a dishonest party tries to double spend suppose alice tries to double spend with bob and charlie one possible approach is for her to try to validate a block that includes both transactions assuming she has one percent of the computing power she will occasionally get lucky and validate the block by solving the proofofwork unfortunately for alice the double spending will be immediately spotted by other people in the infocoin network and rejected despite solving the proofofwork problem so thats not something we need to worry about a more serious problem occurs if she broadcasts two separate transactions in which she spends the same infocoin with bob and charlie respectively she might for example broadcast one transaction to a subset of the miners and the other transaction to another set of miners hoping to get both transactions validated in this way fortunately in this case as weve seen the network will eventually confirm one of these transactions but not both so for instance bobs transaction might ultimately be confirmed in which case bob can go ahead confidently meanwhile charlie will see that his transaction has not been confirmed and so will decline alices offer so this isnt a problem either in fact knowing that this will be the case there is little reason for alice to try this in the first place an important variant on double spending is if alice bob ie alice tries to spend a coin with charlie which she is also spending with herself ie giving back to herself this sounds like it ought to be easy to detect and deal with but of course its easy on a network to set up multiple identities associated with the same person or organization so this possibility needs to be considered in this case alices strategy is to wait until charlie accepts the infocoin which happens after the transaction has been confirmed times in the longest chain she will then attempt to fork the chain before the transaction with charlie adding a block which includes a transaction in which she pays herself unfortunately for alice its now very difficult for her to catch up with the longer fork other miners wont want to help her out since theyll be working on the longer fork and unless alice is able to solve the proofofwork at least as fast as everyone else in the network combined roughly that means controlling more than fifty percent of the computing power then she will just keep falling further and further behind of course she might get lucky we can for example imagine a scenario in which alice controls one percent of the computing power but happens to get lucky and finds six extra blocks in a row before the rest of the network has found any extra blocks in this case she might be able to get ahead and get control of the block chain but this particular event will occur with probability a more general analysis along these lines shows that alices probability of ever catching up is infinitesimal unless she is able to solve proofofwork puzzles at a rate approaching all other miners combined of course this is not a rigorous security analysis showing that alice cannot double spend its merely an informal plausibility argument the original paper introducing bitcoin did not in fact contain a rigorous security analysis only informal arguments along the lines ive presented here the security community is still analysing bitcoin and trying to understand possible vulnerabilities you can see some of this research listed here and i mention a few related problems in the problems for the author below at this point i think its fair to say that the jury is still out on how secure bitcoin is the proofofwork and mining ideas give rise to many questions how much reward is enough to persuade people to mine how does the change in supply of infocoins affect the infocoin economy will infocoin mining end up concentrated in the hands of a few or many if its just a few doesnt that endanger the security of the system presumably transaction fees will eventually equilibriate wont this introduce an unwanted source of friction and make small transactions less desirable these are all great questions but beyond the scope of this post i may come back to the questions in the context of bitcoin in a future post for now well stick to our focus on understanding how the bitcoin protocol works i dont understand why double spending cant be prevented in a simpler manner using twophase commit suppose alice tries to double spend an infocoin with both bob and charlie the idea is that bob and charlie would each broadcast their respective messages to the infocoin network along with a request should i accept this theyd then wait some period perhaps ten minutes to hear any naysayers who could prove that alice was trying to double spend if no such nays are heard and provided there are no signs of attempts to disrupt the network theyd then accept the transaction this protocol needs to be hardened against network attacks but it seems to me to be the core of a good alternate idea how well does this work what drawbacks and advantages does it have compared to the full bitcoin protocol early in the section i mentioned that there is a natural way of reducing the variance in time required to validate a block of transactions if that variance is reduced too much then it creates an interesting attack possibility suppose alice tries to fork the chain in such a way that a one fork starts with a block in which alice pays herself while the other fork starts with a block in which alice pays bob b both blocks are announced nearly simultaneously so roughly half the miners will attempt to mine each fork c alice uses her mining power to try to keep the forks of roughly equal length mining whichever fork is shorter this is ordinarily hard to pull off but becomes significantly easier if the standard deviation of the timetovalidation is much shorter than the network latency d after blocks have been mined on both forks alice throws her mining power into making it more likely that charless transaction is confirmed and e after confirmation of charless transaction she then throws her computational power into the other fork and attempts to regain the lead this balancing strategy will have only a small chance of success but while the probability is small it will certainly be much larger than in the standard protocol with high variance in the time to validate a block is there a way of avoiding this problem suppose bitcoin mining software always explored nonces starting with then if this is done by all or even just a substantial fraction of bitcoin miners then it creates a vulnerability namely its possible for someone to improve their odds of solving the proofofwork merely by starting with some other much larger nonce more generally it may be possible for attackers to exploit any systematic patterns in the way miners explore the space of nonces more generally still in the analysis of this section i have implicitly assumed a kind of symmetry between different miners in practice there will be asymmetries and a thorough security analysis will need to account for those asymmetries lets move away from infocoin and describe the actual bitcoin protocol there are a few new ideas here but with one exception discussed below theyre mostly obvious modifications to infocoin to use bitcoin in practice you first install a wallet program on your computer to give you a sense of what that means heres a screenshot of a wallet called multbit you can see the bitcoin balance on the left bitcoins or about dollars at the exchange rate on the day i took this screenshot and on the right two recent transactions which deposited those bitcoins suppose youre a merchant who has set up an online store and youve decided to allow people to pay using bitcoin what you do is tell your wallet program to generate a bitcoin address in response it will generate a public private key pair and then hash the public key to form your bitcoin address you then send your bitcoin address to the person who wants to buy from you you could do this in email or even put the address up publicly on a webpage this is safe since the address is merely a hash of your public key which can safely be known by the world anyway ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key the person who is going to pay you then generates a transaction lets take a look at the data from an actual transaction transferring bitcoins whats shown below is very nearly the raw data its changed in three ways the data has been deserialized line numbers have been added for ease of reference and ive abbreviated various hashes and public keys just putting in the first six hexadecimal digits of each when in reality they are much longer heres the data hashc ver vin_sz vout_sz lock_time size in prev_out hashae n scriptsig bd out value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash adbf op_equalverify op_checksig lets go through this line by line line contains the hash of the remainder of the transaction c expressed in hexadecimal this is used as an identifier for the transaction line tells us that this is a transaction in version of the bitcoin protocol lines and tell us that the transaction has one input and one output respectively ill talk below about transactions with more inputs and outputs and why thats useful line contains the value for lock_time which can be used to control when a transaction is finalized for most bitcoin transactions being carried out today the lock_time is set to which means the transaction is finalized immediately line tells us the size in bytes of the transaction note that its not the monetary amount being transferred that comes later lines through define the input to the transaction in particular lines through tell us that the input is to be taken from the output from an earlier transaction with the given hash which is expressed in hexadecimal as ae the n tells us its to be the first output from that transaction well see soon how multiple outputs and inputs from a transaction work so dont worry too much about this for now line contains the signature of the person sending the money followed by a space and then the corresponding public key bd again these are both in hexadecimal one thing to note about the input is that theres nothing explicitly specifying how many bitcoins from the previous transaction should be spent in this transaction in fact all the bitcoins from the n th output of the previous transaction are spent so for example if the n th output of the earlier transaction was bitcoins then bitcoins will be spent in this transaction this seems like an inconvenient restriction like trying to buy bread with a dollar note and not being able to break the note down the solution of course is to have a mechanism for providing change this can be done using transactions with multiple inputs and outputs which well discuss in the next section lines through define the output from the transaction in particular line tells us the value of the output bitcoins line is somewhat complicated the main thing to note is that the string adbf is the bitcoin address of the intended recipient of the funds written in hexadecimal in fact line is actually an expression in bitcoins scripting language im not going to describe that language in detail in this post the important thing to take away now is just that adbf is the bitcoin address you can now see by the way how bitcoin addresses the question i swept under the rug in the last section where do bitcoin serial numbers come from in fact the role of the serial number is played by transaction hashes in the transaction above for example the recipient is receiving bitcoins which come out of the first output of an earlier transaction with hash ae line if you go and look in the block chain for that transaction youd see that its output comes from a still earlier transaction and so on there are two clever things about using transaction hashes instead of serial numbers first in bitcoin theres not really any separate persistent coins at all just a long series of transactions in the block chain its a clever idea to realize that you dont need persistent coins and can just get by with a ledger of transactions second by operating in this way we remove the need for any central authority issuing serial numbers instead the serial numbers can be selfgenerated merely by hashing the transaction in fact its possible to keep following the chain of transactions further back in history ultimately this process must terminate this can happen in one of two ways the first possibilitty is that youll arrive at the very first bitcoin transaction contained in the socalled genesis block this is a special transaction having no inputs but a bitcoin output in other words this transaction establishes an initial money supply the genesis block is treated separately by bitcoin clients and i wont get into the details here although its along similar lines to the transaction above you can see the deserialized raw data here and read about the genesis block here the second possibility when you follow a chain of transactions back in time is that eventually youll arrive at a socalled coinbase transaction with the exception of the genesis block every block of transactions in the block chain starts with a special coinbase transaction this is the transaction rewarding the miner who validated that block of transactions it uses a similar but not identical format to the transaction above i wont go through the format in detail but if you want to see an example see here you can read a little more about coinbase transactions here something i havent been precise about above is what exactly is being signed by the digital signature in line the obvious thing to do is for the payer to sign the whole transaction apart from the transaction hash which of course must be generated later currently this is not what is done some pieces of the transaction are omitted this makes some pieces of the transaction malleable ie they can be changed later however this malleability does not include the amounts being paid out senders and recipients which cant be changed later i must admit i havent dug down into the details here i gather that this malleability is under discussion in the bitcoin developer community and there are efforts afoot to reduce or eliminate this malleability in the last section i described how a transaction with a single input and a single output works in practice its often extremely convenient to create bitcoin transactions with multiple inputs or multiple outputs ill talk below about why this can be useful but first lets take a look at the data from an actual transaction hash ver vin_sz vout_sz lock_time size in prev_out hashbeabc n scriptsig cd prev_out hashfdaeb n scriptsig e prev_out hashcb n scriptsig a out value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash ec op_equalverify op_checksig value scriptpubkeyop_dup op_hash de op_equalverify op_checksig lets go through the data line by line its very similar to the singleinputsingleoutput transaction so ill do this pretty quickly line contains the hash of the remainder of the transaction this is used as an identifier for the transaction line tells us that this is a transaction in version of the bitcoin protocol lines and tell us that the transaction has three inputs and two outputs respectively line contains the lock_time as in the singleinputsingleoutput case this is set to which means the transaction is finalized immediately line tells us the size of the transaction in bytes lines through define a list of the inputs to the transaction each corresponds to an output from a previous bitcoin transaction the first input is defined in lines through in particular lines through tell us that the input is to be taken from the n th output from the transaction with hash beabc line contains the signature followed by a space and then the public key of the person sending the bitcoins lines through define the second input with a similar format to lines through and lines through define the third input lines through define a list containing the two outputs from the transaction the first output is defined in lines and line tells us the value of the output bitcoins as before line is an expression in bitcoins scripting language the main thing to take away here is that the string ec is the bitcoin address of the intended recipient of the funds the second output is defined lines and with a similar format to the first output one apparent oddity in this description is that although each output has a bitcoin value associated to it the inputs do not of course the values of the respective inputs can be found by consulting the corresponding outputs in earlier transactions in a standard bitcoin transaction the sum of all the inputs in the transaction must be at least as much as the sum of all the outputs the only exception to this principle is the genesis block and in coinbase transactions both of which add to the overall bitcoin supply if the inputs sum up to more than the outputs then the excess is used as a transaction fee this is paid to whichever miner successfully validates the block which the current transaction is a part of thats all there is to multipleinputmultipleoutput transactions theyre a pretty simple variation on singleinputsingleoutputtransactions one nice application of multipleinputmultipleoutput transactions is the idea of change suppose for example that i want to send you bitcoins i can do so by spending money from a previous transaction in which i received bitcoins of course i dont want to send you the entire bitcoins the solution is to send you bitcoins and to send bitcoins to a bitcoin address which i own those bitcoins are the change of course it differs a little from the change you might receive in a store since change in this case is what you pay yourself but the broad idea is similar that completes a basic description of the main ideas behind bitcoin of course ive omitted many details this isnt a formal specification but i have described the main ideas behind the most common use cases for bitcoin while the rules of bitcoin are simple and easy to understand that doesnt mean that its easy to understand all the consequences of the rules there is vastly more that could be said about bitcoin and ill investigate some of these issues in future posts for now though ill wrap up by addressing a few loose ends how anonymous is bitcoin many people claim that bitcoin can be used anonymously this claim has led to the formation of marketplaces such as silk road and various successors which specialize in illegal goods however the claim that bitcoin is anonymous is a myth the block chain is public meaning that its possible for anyone to see every bitcoin transaction ever although bitcoin addresses arent immediately associated to realworld identities computer scientists have done a great deal of work figuring out how to deanonymize anonymous social networks the block chain is a marvellous target for these techniques i will be extremely surprised if the great majority of bitcoin users are not identified with relatively high confidence and ease in the near future the confidence wont be high enough to achieve convictions but will be high enough to identify likely targets furthermore identification will be retrospective meaning that someone who bought drugs on silk road in will still be identifiable on the basis of the block chain in say these deanonymization techniques are well known to computer scientists and one presumes therefore to the nsa i would not be at all surprised if the nsa and other agencies have already deanonymized many users it is in fact ironic that bitcoin is often touted as anonymous its not bitcoin is instead perhaps the most open and transparent financial instrument the world has ever seen can you get rich with bitcoin well maybe tim oreilly once said money is like gas in the car you need to pay attention or youll end up on the side of the road but a welllived life is not a tour of gas stations much of the interest in bitcoin comes from people whose life mission seems to be to find a really big gas station i must admit i find this perplexing what is i believe much more interesting and enjoyable is to think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a way of enabling new forms of collective behaviour thats intellectually fascinating offers marvellous creative possibilities is socially valuable and may just also put some money in the bank but if money in the bank is your primary concern then i believe that other strategies are much more likely to succeed details ive omitted although this post has described the main ideas behind bitcoin there are many details i havent mentioned one is a nice spacesaving trick used by the protocol based on a data structure known as a merkle tree its a detail but a splendid detail and worth checking out if fun data structures are your thing you can get an overview in the original bitcoin paper second ive said little about the bitcoin network questions like how the network deals with denial of service attacks how nodes join and leave the network and so on this is a fascinating topic but its also something of a mess of details and so ive omitted it you can read more about it at some of the links above bitcoin scripting in this post ive explained bitcoin as a form of digital online money but this is only a small part of a much bigger and more interesting story as weve seen every bitcoin transaction is associated to a script in the bitcoin programming language the scripts weve seen in this post describe simple transactions like alice gave bob bitcoins but the scripting language can also be used to express far more complicated transactions to put it another way bitcoin is programmable money in later posts i will explain the scripting system and how it is possible to use bitcoin scripting as a platform to experiment with all sorts of amazing financial instruments thanks for reading enjoy the essay you can tip me with bitcoin at address ukkktbnlaqdjqqvvaskrvymztz you may also enjoy the first chapter of my forthcoming book on neural networks and deep learning and may wish to follow me on twitter in the united states the question is money a form of speech is an important legal question because of the protection afforded speech under the us constitution in my legally uninformed opinion digital money may make this issue more complicated as well see the bitcoin protocol is really a way of standing up before the rest of the world or at least the rest of the bitcoin network and avowing im going to give suchandsuch a number of bitcoins to soandso a person in a way thats extremely difficult to repudiate at least naively it looks more like speech than exchanging copper coins say published december by michael nielsen categorized as uncategorized pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works enjoying the moment sumedh says december at pm thanks i was always too lazy to look up btc in detail your article cleared most of my questions i wanted to know one thing what if some smart hacker is able to find some vulnerability in the protocol and he uses that to generate new bitcoins for himself once that happens then whole confidence in bitcoins would be gone and it would lead to chaos is the above scenario possible bobby says december at pm your scenario is possible just like any other popular piece of open source software there are incentives for finding exploits but there are a lot of benevolent hackers examining the code to uncover and fix them michael nielsen says december at pm bobby good point yes that solves much of the problem neatly my broad point about asymmetries is still true however and is vividly demonstrated by the rise of large mining pools edit this is in response to your comment below i must have clicked on the wrong link when i replied achil says march at am each block starts with a coinbase transaction which should give bitcoins to the person who solved it since this transaction if different for any block each node working on the network has her bitcoin address as the recipient of that transaction all block in the network are different so we shouldnt at least not likely see two blocks with the same hashes gwern says december at pm that bug has actually happened before but satoshigavin fixed it before anyone else managed to exploit it there have been major live flaws in bitcoin that i know of one allowed you to generate billions of bitcoins and the other allowed you to spend anyones bitcoins neither was exploited before being patched and there dont seem to have been any big flaws found since rena says december at pm interesting how did those exploits work gwern says december at pm i dont know the technical details might want to look up the cves and the patches from the sound of them some validation check was omitted and so bad transactions were allowed bobby says december at pm i believe have the answer to your third question the raw block data that each miner is trying to solve contains a generation transaction that transaction is where their coins are sent if they solve that block because miners competing against each other want their coins to be sent to different addresses and those addresses are hashed together with their nonce it does not matter if everyone starts their nonce from zero the added randomness from differing generation transaction addresses prevents each miner from working in the same space as others michael says december at pm thanks bobby i had wondered about the same question as the author your explanation clears it up for me jc says december at pm moreover the nonces need not be enumerable if randomly picked from a large enough pool it is unlikely that the same nonce gets picked twice carles says december at pm very well written only one thing to add on another post when you launch multibit or bitcoinqt etc where does it connect a list of ips dns etc etc pål driveklepp says december at am bitcoin has methods for finding peers httpsenbitcoinitwikinetworkbootstrapping benoit says december at pm thank you for the great writeup you write ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key did i miss it does it have anything to do with quantum computing michael nielsen says december at pm oops actually i had an extended discussion of this question but deleted it just before i posted the reason i deleted it is that the discussion was inconclusive the separation seems to be a fairly arbitrary design decision there are some minor space and security advantages but not enough in my opinion to justify making the bitcoin address the hash rather than the public key mark friedenbach says december at pm theres a very serious security advantage the public key is not known until the moment it is spent that reduces the window during which the private key could be derived and used in a doublespend to about minutes this has significant ramifications for the safe transition to quantumproof cryptography if nothing else and spacewise were talking about saving hundreds of megabytes soon gigabytes of data from the utxo set thats not insignificant michael nielsen says december at pm mark youve described the two main points in the material i deleted to me both seem like relatively small points on the first point many people reuse addresses so in practice public keys are often widely known this problem could be reduced if bitcoin enforced a policy that addresses could only ever be used once but a thats not going to happen anytime soon b it introduces some other practical problems its useful to be able to publish an address widely and c it would still leave a window of time when the public key is widely known but the transaction is not yet confirmed on the second point i havent computed exactly but i suspect the space savings is less than ten percent of the total transaction size depending on the type of transaction thats significant but it also seems to me that other similar savings could easily have been had but are not so it does seem a bit arbitrary still as you point out its not insignificant actually it occurs to me that its pretty easy to modify the standard bitcoin transaction script so only public keys are used this might make a nice example for my post on bitcoin scripting david says january at am i have read that there is no known algorithm that would allow public keys to be derived from public addresses within a practicable timescale even with quantum computing however the same is not true for deriving private keys from public keys thus addresses that have not been used to spend have benefits in terms of being more qc proof i recall vitalik buterin writing on this topic boldra says december at am could the protocol save even more space by switching from json to yaml it looks like the protocol version is inside the json peter says december at am the json shown in this article is just a representation the blockchain actually lives in files of binary bytes concatenated together ie neither json nor yaml on each users computer benoit says december at pm about your first question what would be the incentive for nonminers to answer your question why would you trust the answers or lack thereof after all if i understand correctly when there is no transaction fee set aside the miners could very well choose to omit transactions from their blocks michael nielsen says december at pm on incentive such could be built into the protocol on trusting the answers if someone claims that they see evidence of double spending youd require them to present evidence in the form of a signed transaction the requirement of a signature makes this hard to forge by a malicious naysayer on your last point yes this is a very interesting question at present this all seems to be working okay but over the long run i suspect will limit the use of bitcoin for small transactions tom says december at am on the last point i could see the transaction fee being indirectly related to the time required to confirm a transfer if you want your transfer confirmed quicker then you have to pay on a related note what happens if blocks are validated out of time order mg says december at pm im curious what happens ifwhen the underlying crypto is either undermined or broken over the years weve seen flaws that reduce the bits entropy in many many systems how would the bitcoin protocol handle say a reduction of even bit of difficulty bit reduction as hard to attack also could someone with very large resources overwhelm the network with bad data eg if china wanted to use some super computers or a bot net to stop bitcoin from operating by adding all sorts of bad data to the block chains michael nielsen says december at pm denial of service type attacks are a real problem see eg httpsenbitcoinitwikiweaknessesdenial_of_service_dos_attacks on the first question the answer is i think thats really complicated and depends on the exact scenario of the break cabin says december at am android had a bug in their random number api that was successfully exploited losing a few bits of entropy wont matter but in this case they lost nearly all of them httpthegenesisblockcomsecurityvulnerabilityinallandroidbitcoinwallets mg says december at pm one additional question what happens to bitcoins that are lost ie what happens if the fbi refuses to sign over the bitcoins seized from silk road or wallets that had some coins but were lost due to hard drive failure bad backups or lost passphrases or maybe someone dies but the next of kin doesnt know the details the comparison is if i drop on the ground or my next of kin finds it under a mattress they can use it michael nielsen says december at pm lost bitcoins are just that gone from the money supply for good unless someone manages to either a recover the keypair or b breaks the underlying crypto mango cat says december at pm that brings up an interesting scenario on a long time scale there will have to be some allowance made for replacement of the lost coins or subdivision of the satoshi james h says december at pm with bitcoin losing the private key for good is more like accidentally dropping your coins out of an airplane over the pacific ocean the private key is crucial to recovering those coins hasitha n liyanage says december at pm looks like we both independently arrived at similar methods of explanation httpzenlkhowifinallyunderstoodbitcoin pingback understanding the bitcoin protocol minsheng 民生 amos says december at pm in the second paragraph of the bitcoin section seems it should be not michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed vidya says december at am thank you so much i had wanted an understandable primer on bitcoin since ages and this was a fabulous read boldra says december at am im surprised that bitcoins in a transaction are a decimal string it looks likely to cause floating point approximation errors have you read about coinjoin it follows on very nicely from what youve described here im looking forward to the next one michael nielsen says december at am theyre not actually a float as i mention in the article the minimal unit of bitcoin is the satoshi which is one one hundred millionth of a bitcoin so its really specifying an integer number of satoshis i havent checked what type is used in the source code id be interested to know michael nielsen says december at pm this page says that it is an integer in the original source httpsenbitcoinitwikiproper_money_handling_jsonrpc however it sounds as though there can occasionally be some floating point rounding issues with code used to do remote procedure calls over the bitcoin network uri says december at am just wanted to say thanks for a really great essay the explanation was really clear and totally fascinating pingback science technology roundup great wall of numbers pingback middayish links dump imagine art there aboutmiddayish links dump pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi geistwc jim says december at pm can quantum computers mine bitcoin faster does this boil down to how quickly a quantum computer can find a string that has a specified property for sha for which we have a quadratic speedup but probably no more i understand that commonly used digital signatures and publickey cryptosystems are broken by quantum computers so theres not much to be said about that michael nielsen says december at am i havent thought much about it with that said im pretty sure both your comments are right quadratic speedup for finding hash collisions and the asymmetric crypto stuff is broken asallai says december at pm this is an incredibly well written article and one that i needed so much thank you michael oli rhys says december at pm thanks for this while i understood the majority of it the coding element was very useful especially highlighting where the script goes in conjunction with the transaction while a lot of people know abot bitcoin there is such a shortage of good quality technical info thanks again andrew jaeger says december at pm great writeup about how bitcoin functions on a technical level but i had a question about it as its use as a currency why is bitcoin built to be inherently deflationary this seems to be the goto argument against why it will ever gain widespread adoption as a currency why does the reward for mining bitcoin halve every blocks could there be a point in the future where this is reversed michael nielsen says december at am good questions and i dont know i certainly suspect as do you that these may ultimately turn out to be design flaws assaf says december at am bitcoin is not deflationary it is inflationary with a known and decreasing rate up until around at which point it will stop being inflationary the only deflation in bitcoin may happen through coin loss the same by the way is true for fiat the difference is that fiat can be arbitrarily inflated and with bitcoin it is not arbitrary as far as why inflation is predetermined this is so bitcoin is a better store of value which is one of the defining properties of a good money why is it inflationary at all as in why not start with a predetermined amount of bitcoins that never change the is part of bitcoins decentralized design bitcoin designers wanted a way to spread bitcoins around without starting with a central authority that has them all and gives them out like say ripple the bitcoin generating part of mining does exactly that btw i am yet to see a good argument about why having a monetary system that is a good store of value and does not get diluted over time with inflation is bad krg says december at pm inflationarydeflationary are properties of currency production relatively to the supply of real goods bitcoin is only not deflationary if you assume that real wealth production will gradually slow and eventually stabilize around at the same pace as the drop in bitcoin production and thats not even accounting for the effective tax pressure of the transaction fee needing to increase to attract the necessary computational power as the system of directly paying for that service phases out the more that needs to be paid out in each transaction to cover the fees the lower prices and actual payments will have to fall to make room for that overhead lower revenue translates to lower ability to afford a given price level and so on bitcoin has already seen hyperdeflation that rewarded early speculators but the defined limitations in supply are far more likely to encourage more speculation over it as a commodity than less making its reliability for any predictable future value never mind usefulness as an accounting measure to reliably store value rather questionable what actually needs to be demonstrated is that there is any value in allowing any static nonproductive account to maintain its nominal value as opposed to using the inherent decline in the value of such accounts provide the baseline motivation to use more productive investments to store anything beyond cash sufficient to meet immediate needs for liquidity theres no justification to use the monetary system to store value because value is a property or real assets not the money that serves to account for them trying to store value in money rather than in future production potential is the ultimate perverse incentive rewarding fraud and financial manipulation far out of proportion to development of real assets mellyra says december at pm assaf is talking about inflationdeflation of the money supply you are talking about price inflationdeflation both usages are common in economics jonathan goldberg says december at pm there are excellent reasons for wanting to store value one obvious one is the desire to save for retirement back in paul samuelson wrote a classic paper on the utility of money as a store of value an exact consumptionloan model of interest with or without the social contrivance of money jpe v dec dave says january at pm actually bitcoin is inherently deflationary if you believe that the size of the bitcoin economy will grow faster than the money supply although not quite intuitive it does make sense upon reflection that the money supply reflects the value of the economy it represents if the money supply is growing faster than the underlying economy then you get inflation if the money supply is growing slower than the economy you get deflation i think all but a few of us expect the bitcoin economy to grow faster than the supply of bitcoins hence we have a deflationary currency the wisdom of that choice is another mater of course one could imagine many different scenarios for the amount and timing and conditions of new currency entering the system if bitcoin doesnt takeovertheworld then my bet is that these will be significant dimensions of experimentation among variants wanton says december at pm im confused about the block chain does everyone have their own version of it or do they sync to a master does every block chain get updated when validation is completed does this mean every person has a record of everyone elses transactions for ever wont this file get really really big michael nielsen says december at am in practice there are thin clients which dont keep a full copy of the block chain but the way the protocol is designed at present there is a sizeable number of people keeping a full copy of the block chain this is currently quite a manageable size about gig if bitcoin grows rapidly enough this may eventually become a problem theres a nice discussion of this and related scalability issues here httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability the conclusion there which seems to me believable is that there are many options for scaling bitcoin at least up to the level at which credit cards are used today and perhaps further sunny says december at pm just about the total amount of bitcoins if i understand well new bitcoins are generated each time a transaction is processed it means the more exchange we have the more bitcoins in the market there is so the only way to raise the number of bitcoins is to spend some energy validating transaction thats a little bit wired for me how were created the first bitcoins is there another way of creating bitcoins that checking transactions and thanks a lot for this post because its really difficult to get a clear picture of what is it regards marco says february at pm not per transaction but per block of transactions exchanges are a bad example the transactions within the exchange happen outside the network only if you deposit or withdrawal btc tofrom an exchange it goes over the network and therefore show up in the block chain there are so many trades going on within an exchange it happens internally and since trades need to happen fast the network is not suited for that yes google for the genesis block thats how it got started no daniel r grayson says december at pm very nice comments you use the concept of mining before defining it change possibility vulnerabilities to possible vulnerabilities fix spending spending money michael nielsen says december at am thanks typos fixed greg says december at pm excellent article i found two typos which you might want to zap bob doesnt just go ahead and accept the transaction instead he broadcast alices message to the entire network change broadcast to broadcasts will infocoin mining end up in concentrated in the hands of a few or many remove first in michael nielsen says december at am thanks typos fixed pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi mark solock blog mango cat says december at pm thanks for the great bitcoin writeup i have gleaned most of what you said in bits and pieces from articles and message boards its nice to see it all described so clearly in one place what i think is more interesting than the cryptography aspect is the socialmotivational aspect of bitcoin and why it seems to be succeeding first big mover and branding seem to be inplay and the anonymous cash myth also was a big factor but beyond that i think the carrot of get paid for solving hard problems often using other peoples computing resources has drawn in many participants who have helped grow the network by promoting their own self interests i balk every time i hear the bit about every transaction for all users for all time is encoded into the block chain especially when combined with the chain is developed by solving hard problems scaling this system to support a billion users transacting multiple times per day seems unlikely your explanation does help to show how the problems dont get much harder as transactions scale up the blocks themselves get larger but the hash problem doesnt get significantly harder as block size grows unless you start talking about transacting the worlds monetary business in such a system then those blocks would get uncomfortably large in a very short time period and the forking problem would be much more complex than choosing between two or three chains to follow i also somewhat disapprove of the concept of encouraging people to mine digital space to earn currency since that creates an artificial demand for energy which could grow into a significant waste of real world resources as such a system scales up i have been playing trust network thought games since the s id like to see a peertopeer digital currency system that is based in the concept of trustworthy digital identities instead of solving hash problems to get paid you could still get paid by validating transactions but it wouldnt have that appeal of solve more problems get more paid plus a system based on trust would tend to concentrate trust in central authorities that would be quickly perceived as hopeless to surpass in trustworthiness semidefeating the incentive to participate as a trusted member of the network unless some kind of carrot to the underdogs was included which would be purely socialmotivational instead of a technically required component anyway all very interesting to watch as usual i got in late and out early with bitcoin bought around sold around seemed like an awesome profit margin at the time that aspect of bitcoin is a lot like any other speculative investment and is certainly fueling interest at this stage michael nielsen says december at am on scalability check out httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability theres a lot of useful information there like you though i wonder about the longrun economics and impact of mining michael newman says december at pm thanks for writing this great explanation of bitcoin i noticed in the first bitcoin transaction example you mention bitcoins but the example really deals with bitcoins where bitcoins goes to one person and there is a bitcoin transaction fee in other words did you mean instead of also is there a need to show value as an image michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed joseph reagle says december at pm typo trying to understand possibility vulnerabilities possible michael nielsen says december at am thanks fixed jack l says december at pm thanks for the excellent writeup i have a question about one item hopefully you can explain it it appears the money you send someone is merely chunks of one or more previous transactions lets say i receive bitcoin at myaddress_ and i receive bitcoin at myaddress_ i now want to send you bitcoins from myaddress_ those previous transactions are the inputs for my transaction to you how does the transaction message for the bitcoin transaction prove that i was the recipient of those previous transactions when the addresses are all different is the hash for each input in the new transaction something that can only be generated by whoever was the recipient in the original transactions myaddress_ or myaddress_ if the answer is yes then it seems like unique addresses can be easily linked in which case i dont see any anonymity advantage of using new addresses for each transaction sorry if im missing something obvious here michael nielsen says december at am the proof is in the digital signature that signature is generated using a public key which must match when hashed the address from the output to the earlier transaction that proves that the bitcoins are the payers to spend ajay says december at pm but if i understand correctly the need for every transaction to be publicly verified means that you are tied to all your transactions you cant maintain a double life if i were a criminal i might find it very desirable to have two personas stringer who sells drugs and russell bell wellknown property developer and pillar of the community and use the cash that stringer collects to bankroll russells legitimate businesses but theres no way to do that with bitcoin i cant transfer stringers bitcoins to russell without everyone else in the world knowing about it anyone with a copy of the block chain can notice that the flow of money goes from various drug users to stringer to russell jim lyon says december at pm if you really want to enable money laundering first create a bank a bank would let any customer use bitcoin transactions to deposit andor withdraw value and the bank would keep its own record of individual customers accounts when withdrawing bitcoins you would get bitcoins that were the banks to give but that were unrelated to the ones you originally deposited such a bank would have more uses than just money laundering it could pay interest make loans charging interest convert bitcoins tofrom more traditional currencies etc space says december at pm extending from j lyons answer say you need to send from one or more of your bitcoin addresses to a badguy but wish to anonymize this transaction you will use a trusted middleman that does several transactions each day some with goodguys and some with badguys in one simple scenario the middleman sets up a recievables address xxx into which all the depositors send their bitcoins ie the depositors all use xxx address as their output the middleman then transfers out the necessary amounts to intermediate addresses yyy yyym that he has set up specifically for this transaction period after this is done the middleman provides the yyy addresses one to each reciever because all the incoming money has gone into the xxx address there is no way to separate out subsequently which money went to which reciever if all the yyyy addresses belong to bad guys then you would be guilty by association many bitcoin services perform such mixing by default based on what i have read the legal ramifications for the mixing service provider are unclear to me ajay says december at am got it thanks but such a bank would have to keep its own records both as a practical necessity and as a legal requirement and those could be obtained by the authorities whereas cash can be laundered tracelessly through a cash business like a casino or restaurant which can perfectly innocently be expected to have lots of cash coming in and no way of knowing where it comes from avee says december at pm interestingly this is exactly what was done with silk road it basically was a bitcoin bank moving bitcoins around in such a way the buyer and seller could not be connected theres a paper which has some details about that httpicdnturnercommoneyimagessilkroadpaperpdf con kolivas says december at pm nonce starting at zero is not a vulnerability shares are stochastically distributed throughout the nonce range and it makes no difference where you start the nonce is simply bits out of the whole bit coinbase that you are hashing and there is no way to design a target solution to be distributed anywhere within the nonce range of those bits if you start at a higher nonce value you simply will have less possible chances at finding a solution before youll need to getcreate a new coinbase to hash alex f says december at pm i think maybe youre misinterpreting his concern the danger isnt that someone can solve blocks strictly faster by starting at a different nonce because as you say the correct nonce could be anywhere in the range so every guess has the same chance of being correct instead the danger is that someone could solve blocks faster than everyone else if they start at a higher nonce and everyone else starts at specifically assuming on average everyone can calculate guesses at the same rate then any transaction whose correct nonce is higher than x will always be solved first by someone who started at y if yx of course this creates an obvious incentive for all participants to try to guess nonces in a different order than everyone else so it seems reasonable that most client software would use a random sequence of nonce guesses rather than guessing sequentially from but still if one were to find a vulnerability in the random number generator of a popular client then it might be possible to design a competing client which would in practice almost always find the correct nonce before the targeted client by virtue of guessing the same sequence a few steps ahead that would allow the attacker to successfully validate a share of blocks greater than their actual portion of the collective computational power at the cost of everyone using the vulnerable client and finding the nonce less often than they should on average gergely imreh says december at pm i think theres also a time field in the part that is hashed which is also updated every few seconds thus in practice its not the case that everyone has the same message and they just run the nonces but everyone has a different message regardless of the nonces see httpsenbitcoinitwikiblock_hashing_algorithm michael nielsen says december at am alex has explained my concern well however as a number of people have pointed out including gergely in fact there are in any case small differences in the blocks being hashed by different miners and thats sufficient to make this a nonissue rubberman says december at pm a most excellent and well written article i look forward to more thanks pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works adafruit industries blog bram stolk says december at am as people make transactions the public ledger grows will it not grow to an unmanageable size at some time julian says december at am i have a couple questions possibly a subject for a future article if the block chain forks do the miners on both sides of the fork keep their rewards if so doesnt it allow someone to continue executing the proof of work even when it is known that someone else has solved the proof of work i am puzzled by transactions in blocks is it not possible for two miners to be working on different blocks which contain mostly although not all the same transactions then the first one to solve the proof of work will have validated some of the transactions in the second miners block does the second miner restart by taking his unverified transactions and putting them in a new block michael nielsen says december at am on yes if youre mining and someone else validates some of the transactions you are working on then you remove them from your queue but continue working with the unvalidated transactions on its true that in different forks different miners will have been rewarded however over time only one of the forks will become the accepted consensus for confirmed transactions and so only the miners from one fork will be able to redeem their transactions rob says december at am fascinating read thank you one thing im having difficulty with is block chain integrity what will happen when an owner loses his wallet restores a backup from a few weeks back he may have spent some coins and he may have received some those transactions are no longer in his block chain how would the block chain get back in sync on your questiontoyourself about using two phase commit i think the major issue would be vulnerability to denialofservice attack a malicious user could set up a swarm of identities to act as naysayers and therewith deny some or all others from performing transactions benjamin marty says december at am in my experience using the bitcoin client you are not allowed to do anything on the bitcoin network until your block chain is in sync with the latest transactions it somehow recognizes how far behind your block chain is and starts downloading blocks and tells you how old your block chain is and how much left you have to update as it downloads more btw i uninstalled the bitcoin client because over the year span that i had it installed the block chain went from about gb to about gb and the novelty of having my own copy of the block chain wore off in comparison to its cost it would be nice if there were some kind of reset block that could be generated that flattened the tree into a single block enumerating the value stored at each address michael nielsen says december at am on the naysayer ddos attack on twophase commit if someone claims that they see evidence of double spending youd require them to present evidence in the form of a signed transaction the requirement of a signature makes this hard to forge by a malicious naysayer pingback the bitcoin protocol iamronen pingback links naked capitalism uez says december at am here is a very entertaining rational explanation httpwwwbringhurstorghowdoesbitcoincryptoworkhtml pingback bitcoin for dummies author walks users through how bitcoin actually works my blog benjamin marty says december at pm one thing i still dont fully understand is how the bitcoin reward size is decided and awarded who enforces the rules that bitcoins are awarded for validating a block and a few years hence itll be bitcoins if we were to decide that the rewards should be different remaining at indefinitely for example what exactly would have to change is it the bitcoin mining clients that are hardwired to only validate transactions that award coins to other miners when they validate their blocks and the date of the validated block indicates that the award should be btc michael nielsen says december at am its hardcoded based on the number of blocks in the blockchain every blocks the rate halves no need to keep track of the date simply count blocks michal says december at pm hi and cannot miners just continue to validating the the transaction with adding bitcoins as the chain is just validated list of transactions how there can be any cap on transactions what does hardcoded mean practically jozef says february at pm you only own that much of bitcoins as others agree you own so hardcoded here means it is the original protocol suggested and supposed to be honored by all the users theres no use for miner to continue giving himself btc when its already time for lowering the reward to because this reward would not be considered valid by others who respect the original protocol anton d says may at pm would it be in principle possible for all miners to agree on not lowering the reward at all for example to continue to reward per block for all eternity nick p says december at pm i hadnt had time to thoroughly delve into the protocol and your excellent writeup is the exact piece by piece whatwhy i needed the whys are extremely important to people who might want to build on top of the protocol as it helps them understand what they should or shouldnt modify pebird says december at pm i was thinking about how the blockchain is managed as more transactions are processed thanks for the link httpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability interesting one of the potential solutions discussed is the use of dedicated servers instead of lightweight clients to increase transaction rates reduce latency handle increasing blockchain size via techniques such as pruning the chain etc what this implies of course is an evolution into banks a group of entities with sufficient resources and staying power to dedicate specialized btc infrastructure for transaction handling in a way bitcoin is replicating a history of money evolution in an accelerated manner i wonder what will take place in the protocol to allow the peertopeer nature to continue while scaling the project to allow the transaction capacity necessary for a true currency michael nielsen says december at am yeah that is very interesting i dont run a full client myself i use a thin client that doesnt have a full copy of the block chain and you do already see a lot of signs of centralization

it all means the devil and the delight are in the details stuart quimby terikan says december at pm bitcoin has fascinated me recently i admit to not being able to fully wrap my head around it but i took what i could and wrote a little here httpmimictradingcomviewtopicphpft maybe you can help me out with one part of this i dont quite get the signature how does the block chain know that the address sending the coins is correct the sender sends their sig to go with it i assume paired up with the hash of the address allows the various nodes to validate right but if you are sending your sig out then cant any node have access to that private info they would need to in order to validate so can a sig only be used once and if so how is it generated and what prevents it from being faked cryptograffre says december at am httpsenwikipediaorgwikidigital_signature public key cryptography is a remarkable and beautiful thing each client using bitcoin has keypairs one key in each pair is public the other private the nature of asymmetric cryptographic digital signatures is that i can sign any piece of data using my private key and anyone else with only my public key can verify that the person who signed that data holds the private key theres some fascinating mathematics involved exploiting a simple numerical relationship between the public and private keys richnormand says december at pm very nicely done writeup makes me wonder about the news at various times about a major theft of bitcoins mostly in exchanges in order to benefit they would have to be converted or be reintroduced later on some of these were for large amounts and not really easy to hide unless you just sit on them michael nielsen says december at am ive wondered the same thing some observations if you copy someones private key and then erase their copy there is no way for them to prove that it was ever truly their key and if two people both have a copy of the private key how do you determine who truly owns it the situation is complicated further by the possibility of laundering if you quickly spend some stolen bitcoins on then it becomes very different to later recover those bitcoins

modified version of the software to choose not to publish a transaction in the blockchain i mean like a small group of powerful miners controlling the entire network mark says december at pm if you control half or more of the total mining power in the network you can keep a transaction out of the blockchain by solving blocks faster on average than the miners who are trying to include that

problem bitcoins arent actually backed by anything other than server time there was a time in this country when you can go to the bank and trade in your dollar bill for an oz of gold you cant do that anymore bc today dollars are back by debt not gold but bitcoins are backed by server time that almost makes less sense than backed by debt thomas mahoney says december at pm i think youre confusing an investment with a medium of exchange an investment should be backed up by something in the sense that it should give the holder a claim future cash flows or other real assets but a medium of exchange is just that something used to facilitate trade an accounting device it should have scarcity value and be resistant to counterfeiting fiat currencies have scarcity value to the extent that they are usually printed in finite amounts gold is generally scarce and bitcoin is scarce as well gold has been used as a medium of exchange for centuries what is it backed up by nothing its just scarce and therefore suitable as a medium of exchange miksa says december at pm bbc had an interesting article called why do we value gold few days ago httpwwwbbccouknewsmagazine marco says february at pm if

your rss feeds i came here from bruce schneiers blog and i like what i see so i subscribed in goreadio but neither of your feeds has anything newer than the beginning of id like to clarify im grateful for your posts and im not complaining if youve dumped the whole rss thing google did why shouldnt you but if you _havent_ dumped rss but it was supposed to be getting updated automatically it isnt

thought you might like to know that at least for some of us rss aint sing michael nielsen says december at pm i checked in my rss reader the old reader and both blogs seem to come through fine odd marc says december at am it just now showed up in my feed december pacific time where its been all this time i may never know just thought id let you know joseph says december at pm am i to understand that it takes about minutes to pay somebody through the bitcoin network i reached this conclusion based on the minute average block confirmation and the requirement of it being back in the chain before it is considered confirmed thanks joseph michael nielsen says december at pm full confirmation requires about minutes many people are willing to accept payment on more trust though say after just a single confirmation mins yes this is a significant disadvantage of the protocol in its present architecture marco says february at pm transactions are instant confirmations are not a confirmation takes minutes if you want full confirmation then yes on average it takes an hour confirmations for ecommerce this will probably work in most cases for retail this can be an issue however there are a few points if you try to double spend it doesnt mean you will succeed it is not easy to double spend in front of the cash register unless you have build some app and are all prepared the merchant i think bitpay is doing this can listen on the network to see if there was a double spend attempt those are easily detected dont forget that a credit card payment can be charged back months

all i got is the hash of the public key dont i need the full public key for that instead of only the hash what am i missing guys michael nielsen says december at pm the transaction contains the

of places in the article tom hatcher says december at pm thank you best explanation ive seen so far i still dont understand it completely but its slowly becoming clearer one question though i hear that its open source and we can look at the source code id like to do that its written in c where can i find the code and look at it thank you tom hatcher says december at am i answer my own question its at githubcom fee fi fo fum says december at pm i would love to see you discuss tumblers and the effectiveness and possibility of anonymizing your bitcoins pingback friday links meta rabbit pingback bitcoin pingback virtual mining bitcoin news bitcoin open source money whose time has come cb says december at am in your anonymous section you speak of debunking a fairly huge myth without really backing it up you just state the equivalent of actually its not anonymous without going into detail i dont believe that to be true unless you are implying that various ways of using the internet anonymously are breakable for instance if tor is compromised versus if it is not or if other methods of obscuring traffic surrounding use of bitcoins are insufficient your assertion that bitcoin is open and transparent has nothing to do with its ability to use it anonymously and the claim that it wouldnt be able to achieve convictions but will narrow the pool of suspects down sound closer to a statement of successful anonymity rather than unsuccessful michael nielsen says december at am you just state the equivalent of actually its not anonymous without going into detail its certainly not meant to be a proof i do however go a great deal further than just saying its not anonymous i reference a large and growing body of academic literature that takes supposedly anonymous data sets and then deanonymizes them i believe techniques similar to those used in those papers will be very useful for attacking bitcoin there are complications in bitcoin notably that some people though far from all routinely use new addresses for each transaction that makes an interesting challenge and i think is different than in earlier work on deanonymization ill be most curious to hear what the deanonymizers have to say after making a sustained attempt at bitcoin magnus sorenson says december at pm linking bitcoin addresses to a real identity requires that a real identity is somehow associated with an address in the first place if i buy bitcoin on the street with cash without revealing any personal information using a public network and a device with a mac address that cant be linked to me then i can spend that bitcoin with absolute anonymity unless i reveal personal info to whoever i send that bitcoin to in the case of silk road the guy who sends me the drugs would need my mailing address but that can be fudged as well if he does not store my mailing address nothing gets linked to me if the drugs arrive safely throw in a mixing service and on that transaction not even the nsa can id me from the blockchain now if i do the same thing many times it may be possible to id me using other vectors but explain how anyone could id me using the blockchain if i buy the bitcoin with cash on the street and spend it leaving no permanent record i assert that bitcoin can be anonymous forever if you do it right merkletree says december at am the system is anonymous but traceable if you receive bit coins from somewhere and never spend them thats fine but it becomes possible to track addresses back to wallets via change addresses that are created during man transactions there are several other methods as well i suggest you look up bitiodine httpowlysyzv you will find that many addresses can be identified with a bit of heuristic effort to remain anonymous you have to take pretty extreme measures this includes the use of tumblers and foggers but you cannot guarantee they will work this leads to the interesting point that if you steal bit coins they are dangerous to spend adam back says december at am you mention using multiple subpuzzles to reduce variance this is a bad idea as it introduces progress because bitcoin is a firstpastthepost race progress gives an unfair advantage to more powerful miners x reward for x power michael nielsen says december at am youre presuming a particular design in which people solve a set of puzzles privately there is no necessity to make that presumption this is why i make the first part of the statement with some careful design it is possible to considerably reduce the variance in the time to validate a block of transactions i havent worked out the best possible design however i have found a design whose distribution is quite a bit more sharply peaked around minutes than the current puzzle unfortunately the details are more complex than i want to write out right now i may come back to it in a future post adam back says december at am also you talk about risk of nonce reuse this wont happen because people mine for their own reward address so even if the nonce is reused the work proof wont be further in the case of pool mining the pools hand out work specifically to avoid nonce reuse which is somewhat insecure as others could guess the work range of other users and race them to produce it and finally the secure way is pooled miners use getblocktemplate and use a large random counter start extranonce if extranonce is large enough and random the probability of nonce collision is pratically you can read about this in the hashcash paper httphashcashorgpapershashcashpdf or httpsenbitcoinitwikihashcash for decentralization miners should also choose their own blocks by running as a full node and filling in the details into the coinbase provided by getblocktemplate adam back says december at am twophase commit if you are willing to wait minutes bitcoin already does that i presume the form it would take is the proof of double spend would be one of the double spends there have been proposals to forward doublespends with a doublespent marker currently the first only is received maybe just an api to ask if there are any transactions conflicting with a given transaction a user could ask a few random nodes to gain confidence you also have to bear in mind preserving the confirmation spend functionality many people rely on that for low value point of sale transactions srm says december at pm ill return later to the question of why the bitcoin address is a hash and not just the public key i dont think you ever come back to this topic michael nielsen says december at pm see the discussion above in reply to benoit mason pingback bitcoins cash and gold gusbook johnt says december at pm thank you for the primer you might consider removing the footnote imo bitcoin cannot be successfully defended as free speech free speech is not a full blown unlimited right as yelling fire in a crowded theater reminds us but article i section subparagraph does grant congress full power to coin money and declare its value and a subsequent subparagraph grants congress full power to outlaw any currency it wishes for citizen uses as legal tender thus imo the supreme court could never allow free speech to prevail over congresss unfettered constitutional authority i hope this comment does not derail a great discussion of bitcoin please delete my comment if it becomes a red herring pingback plaidoyer pour le bitcoin complexitéscomplexités pingback occupy bitcoin pingback how to not get rich from bitcoin turings invisible hand pingback bitcoin the economic frontier of a digital age the american statesmen pingback why you need to own bitcoin winning bitcoin johnp says december at pm a question re the part about everyone collectively is the bank in particular well assume that everyone using infocoin keeps a complete record of which infocoins belong to which person assuming millions and perhaps eventually billions are using bitcoins so for example billions of transactions could take place daily times this by the qty of bitcoins each single one being unique times this by the billions using bitcoins then what affect would that have on the network michael nielsen says december at pm already addressed in comments above pingback bitcoin a bit risky learn about finance careers pavel masyuk says december at pm that question about a nounce i think that the parametres of the puzzle differs for every single miner everyones desired block contains a unique transaction that no other miner has a transation of giving a reward to himself so there is no point in trying to trick others parametres of their puzzles are different its ok for everyone to just try etc michael nielsen says december at pm already addressed in comments above joshua holden says december at pm so if ive got this right one proofofwork computation takes about minutes and you you currently get bitcoins for doing it and each bitcoin is currently worth about usd right if so this only makes sense if most proofofwork computations dont get finished andor dont get rewarded is that usually because someone else got there first do you know about what fraction of proofofwork computations get rewarded this was really useful thanks steffen says march at pm joshua yes its a race whoever finds the hash that is smaller than the currently defined difficulty they will gain the reward for the block the difficulty is adapted every two weeks or so to reflect the changing now growing power of the network the power is growing so fast and so much that some already call it an arms race st pingback various well written articlessites gsr blog pingback bitcoin transactions explained how the commodore was bitcoin razor chris crozier says december at am thanks for the article very interesting but i dont see any mechanism for recombining fractional bitcoins im puzzled by what seems to be an everincreasing fragmentation it seems that over time you would accumulate a large number of coins of varying fractional values and to make a payment you would have to lump together a collection of fractional coins to equal or exceed the transaction required then typically end up with paying yourself your change this oneway process of cutting off pieces of a bitcoin would continue steadily a holding of one bitcoin would end up being constituted of maybe hundred or thousands of differentlysized fractions if thats the case that will make transactions increasingly messy you may have to consolidate a large number of inputs for one payment in turn that will lead to the block chain file growing faster and faster did i miss something michael nielsen says december at am this is not a problem yes some transactions will fragment bitcoins but other transactions undo fragmentation for example a input output transaction will reduce fragmentation this sounds a little complex for the user but in practice good client software will make this invisible you simply say i want to send suchandsuch bitcoins to soandso address and all the details of combining transactions will be taken care of in this sense its actually easier than cash where we deal with the fragmentation defragmentation problem all the time ie finding the right combination of bills and coins to pay for a service and then dealing with the resulting change pingback digitopoly time for a little bitcoin discussion amit prakash says december at am amazing article looking forward for more on similar topics may b someday youll explain for tor pingback how and why bitcoin will plummet in price pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works and what that means for us helping public markets grow edward says december at pm very informative article thank you i was wondering with regard to transaction fees i assume it is up to the first miner to successfully validate a block to determine if your offered fee is large enough to be included in the next iteration of the block chain additionally i assume you have to determine what fee youre willing to pay well in advance of the next chain being verified if this is the case and we fastforward to wont all miners assuming the computing power isnt concentrated be incentivized to take any transaction fee no matter how small for instance if i have of the computing power i should on average validate a block once every years hopefully the maths right it would be infrequent in any regard and considering assuming there would be no marginal cost to include a transaction or transactions offering me only equivalent in transaction fees i cant think of why i wouldnt validate that transaction as such even if there were a few big players who controlled say of the computing power on average one in blocks would be validated by a smaller player who wouldnt care about pricing since people already wait nearly an hour to finalize a transaction likely theyd be willing to wait an extra minutes and as such the big miners would likely just lower their fee thresholds pretty substantially wouldnt this create an odd prisoners dilemmaesque situation maybe im missing something but it strikes me that this would end with low fees forcing people out of business until computing power concentrated amongst an oligomonopoly of miners who could exercise sufficient pricing control which as you pointed out would probably create integrity concerns i believe ive previously read somewhere that there was a price threshold required to incentivize mining at different levels of complexity for instance if bitcoin were tomorrow would miners continue to mine or would the marginal cost of running the equipment outweigh the reward ignoring fees if thats the case and a scenario like that occurs does bitcoin grind to a halt or will some miners shut down or start running less expensive equipment as they did when bitcoin was in that price range i guess this sort of boils down to whether the use of high cost computing equipment is a function of competition and price or problem complexity both are hypothetical but i was curious to know if you or anyone had considered these questions thanks again for the article edward says december at am i think i figured out the answer to i was unaware of how difficulty was calculated pingback explaining bitcoin in a bar pingback cryptocurrency catandmouse games in china great wall of numbers pingback random thoughts bitcoin jimmyweg says january at pm great article im working on a case and see that the bitcoin user employed more than a dozen different applications anoncoin phenixcoin primecoin etc i take it that the protocol is the same among the clients though hash algorithms proofs of concept and the like may differ from what i understand if i use xpms and want to buy something from a vendor who accepts btcs i have to go through some broker or exchange facility to complete the transaction if thats correct and considering the us in a vacuum isnt it like were all carrying around a different brand of currency usds yen pounds etc and have to exchange them almost every time we want to buy something its easy with credit cards but i dont see a similar approach with bitcoins thanks david says january at am i dont understand why double spending cant be prevented in a simpler manner using twophase commit suppose alice tries to double spend an infocoin with both bob and charlie the idea is that bob and charlie would each broadcast their respective messages to the infocoin network along with a request should i accept this theyd then wait some period perhaps ten minutes to hear any naysayers who could prove that alice was trying to double spend if no such nays are heard and provided there are no signs of attempts to disrupt the network theyd then accept the transaction this protocol needs to be hardened against network attacks but it seems to me to be the core of a good alternate idea how well does this work what drawbacks and advantages does it have compared to the full bitcoin protocol i think something along these lines is planned on top of all that is a long list of new features and improvements id like to see get into a release the highest priorities on my wish list are first doublespend relay and detection detecting attempted doublespends as soon as possible is great for lowvalue inperson transactions and we should do more to support that use case httpsbitcoinfoundationorgblogp david says january at am great article i will use it as a selfstudy tutorial in your next instalment could you give a broad description of where the protocol is actually to be found is it a particular piece of software how can it be changed who can change it and indeed to what extent is it capable of being changed these are important questions because they go to the ability of bitcoin to evolve and develop but it is very hard to find any good general account of these issues best regards david nitan shalon says january at pm if satoshi

alice has published her message its possible for other people to duplicate the message so in that sense forgery is possible how can someone forge the message without alices private cryptographic key pingback de week in woorden bits of freedom dave says january at pm hi great article thanks for putting it together i am still having one big problem and i feel like i must be missing something obvious you wrote suppose alice tries to double spend with bob and charlie one possible approach is for her to try to validate a block that includes both transactions assuming she has one percent of the computing power she will occasionally get lucky and validate the block by solving the proofofwork unfortunately for alice the double spending will be immediately spotted by other people in the infocoin network and rejected despite solving the proofofwork problem so thats not something we need to worry about who is going to be looking to reject it and what does that even mean if a malicious party alice manages to complete a block that contains transactions that are not in fact valid then what do other miners check them before building on top of her faulty block and if not then what does it mean for others to spot them this has been bugging me for days your thoughts would be greatly appreciated michael nielsen says january at pm anyone with a copy of the block chain is not going to accept an additional block which has an obvious attempt to double spend in it dave says january at pm thanks so that means that miners examine each block for conflicts before they choose to build on it and if thats true how is the overhead of that inspection built into the incentive structure will their block if they solve it become invalidated if down the line someone points out that they built on a block with a double spend that would make sense but it isnt a step that i have seen described michael nielsen says january at pm checking for a double spend within a block is computationally negligible pingback bitcoins the hard way using the raw bitcoin protocol bitcoin daniel park says february at am thats a long detailed process of bitcoin above which was a great read i dont quite understand near the end but i definitely get the gist of it i dont perfectly understand the relationship between transactions and blocks is this only required when ppl try to cheat the system if so the money earned by miner essentially is imaginary and something that only exists within trust that bitcoin is going to continue to work i guess there are two cases as miners get bitcoins the value of bitcoin comparison to other currencies drop this is probably the case or as miners get bitcoins if it comes to a point where everyone wants to convert their bitcoins to real currency its not going to equal each other bitcoins conversion via bitcoin exchange rate not enough real money also why assume every blocks is occurs every years is this an assumption based on bitcoin flow so far wouldnt every blocks occur more often if there is more flow steffen says march at pm if everybody would like to exit bitcoin at the same time the price would collapse the current speculation is though that the opposite is true many people try to buy bitcoins for the fiat money how many please see here httpfiatleakcom with regards to why blocks are created in roughly four years the network difficulty is set so that only six blocks per hour can be created roughly every minutes a new block enters the blockchain lets do the math years days hours hours blocks pingback on bitcoin emergent chaos pingback bitcoin critical massexplosion wheres it going turing machine pingback bitcoin beyond money soshitech social media technology soshitechcom pingback bitcoin reading for developers coffee spoons of code jozef says february at pm fairly good explanation although some important things missing one mistake though so if we want the output hash value to begin with zeroes say then david will need on average to try approx different values for x before he finds a suitable nonce i think it should be on average at worst it is michael nielsen says february at pm no the average number of trials is if we repeatedly sample from a bernoulli random variable with probability p of a success then the expected number of trials to success is sum_ninfty n p pn which is easily shown to be p the probability p in the proofofwork is so the expected number of trials to success is what important things are missing from the explanation pingback the homebrew litecoin mining project record important events of digital currencies pingback complete dogecoin guide introduction into mining everything doge lex says february at am i have alot of questions about bitcoin and ive done alot of searching this explanation has to be the one that has got me the closest to the answers ive been looking for unfortunately im still falling short of understanding alot of the basic i do want to ask question here which seems to be the most important question for me in computer science terms what is a bitcoin there were points in this article where it seemed close to specifying this although i may have actually missed the answer so what is a bitcoin is it a unique value if i have bitcoins what is it that i really have unique values or is it simply a value that was said to be giving to me and simply assigned a value sort of like the th entry in a ledger in the genesis block it was said bitcoin was givin to whom ever bitcoin was given to bill and we will call that overall im still searching for clarity on the fundamental idea of a bitcoin from a computer science view pingback how the bitcoin protocol actually works ddi arca david lee says february at pm michael we are organising world bitcoin

what a great writeup as for your first authors question there are probably several less complex methods for confirmation but there is inherent security in the current approach which appears to organically solve the problem without risky reliance on factors and layers outside the network itself pingback daily btc pboc edition token intelligence pingback enter the blockchain how bitcoin can turn the cloud inside out techcrunch momingle says march at pm there is one part that i am not sure i understand for example let say miner a has on his queue transaction a b and c to validated on a new block is it possible miner b will have transaction b c and d in his queue but not a that he will validate in his new block assuming both solve the puzzle now both transactions b and c are in two different blocks will both blocks got accepted pingback quora nagaraj hubli says march at pm thanks for the writeup it helped my a lot in understanding the underlying tech of the bitcoin protocol cant wait for the next in series elvin says april at am the protocol rules in the bitcoin wiki are ambiguous when an incoming block designates as its predecessor a block somewhere down in the main branch what happens exactly the wiki can be interpreted in two ways nothing at all the incoming block is not added as the beginning of a side branch the incoming block is added as the possible beginning of a side branch but without any verification for the moment if that is the case then most blocks in the main branch should have many brothers elvin says april at am i have verified that the correct answer is i have also found what limits the number of brothers for a block miners stop mining as soon as they receive a valid node and therefore no new blocks are sent their neighbours do not relay the blocks they might have sent in the meantime sorry for asking fivebuckchuck says may at pm thanks for the write up how do transactions get organized into blocks are nodes broadcasting transacations or blocks number of transactions in a block is that hardcoded in the protocol in your example of hhello worldnonce is hello world a unique transaction or the whole block pingback bitcoin family tree randolog rich says may at am suppose bitcoin mining software always explored nonces starting with x then x x ldots if this is done by all or even just a substantial fraction of bitcoin miners then it creates a vulnerability namely its possible for someone to improve their odds of solving the proofofwork merely by starting with some other much larger nonce more generally it may be possible for attackers to exploit any systematic patterns in the way miners explore the space of nonces this is incorrect because the block hash is dependant on the contents of the block for there to be any possibility of a miner improving his odds through this method the miner must be mining the exact same block as someone else including not using his own address for coinbase and transaction fees to go to removing the entire incentive for mining comments are closed previous post neural networks and deep learning first chapter now live next post reinventing explanation ddi proudly powered by

from them i currently use defillama for this but i feel like there are better options what forums sites do you all use to quickly get updated on new stuff comments share save posted by hours ago question okay so hear me out i randomly get a text on whatsapp from a chinese girl who was supposedly trying to contact her driver to pick her up then she asks me my age and all that and we start talking a bit at this point im suspicious it might be a romance scam i called her though and she really is a female and does sound chinese and it doesnt sound like a voice changer or anything she also frequently changes her profile picture with selfies and i looked them up on google reverse image search and its not coming up with anything so i think that might really be her then we get to talking about hobbies and she says shes into crypto and investing and then i say hey me too and then she goes on about this supposed smart mining website which gives you returns per day of whatever you deposit her english is really bad but from what she explained it sounds like some sort of flashloan thing i checked the website in inspect element on google chrome and its full of chinese it also doesnt work or do anything on pc she told me i have to specifically download the mew wallet app and open the website in the mew apps browser here is the website ehahftop honestly it totally looks and feels like a scam and it probably is ive just never seen a scam like this before first of all this chinese girl somehow got my phone number and i dont live in the us so its pretty rare to get scam calls here and second she actually engaged in conversation and acted like my friend for a good days on whatsapp i dont know why shes so persistent or what she knows about me but please please please someone check the website and at least tell me what kind of scam it is because this is truly one of the weirdest encounters ive had in a long time i repeat she says it only works specifically if you open the website in the mew wallet apps browser but im not about to do it on my phone even with a fake wallet since who knows maybe its an exploit that hacks into my whole phone this does seem like a pretty advanced scam after all comments share save posted by hours ago question is there any way to currently tumble my funds open to creative methods using a nonkyc cex etc not doing anything sus but

rows find out how we work by clicking here read more welcome to coinmarketcapcom this site was founded in may by brandon chez to provide uptodate cryptocurrency prices charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets since then the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency has grown exponentially and we are very proud to have grown with it we take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative we stand for accurately timely and unbiased information here at coinmarketcap we work very hard to ensure that all the relevant and uptodate information about cryptocurrencies coins and tokens can be located in one easily discoverable place from the very first day the goal was for the site to be the number one location online for crypto market data and we work hard to empower our users with our unbiased and accurate information each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token normally the graph starts at the launch of the asset but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs these charts and their information are free to visitors of our website we receive updated cryptocurrency prices directly from many exchanges based on their pairs we then convert the number to usd a full explanation can be found here related links new to crypto learn how to buy bitcoin today ready to learn more visit our crypto glossary and learning hub want to look up a transaction visit our blockchain explorer we calculate our valuations based on the total circulating supply of an asset multiplied by the currency reference price the topic is explained in more detail here we calculate the total cryptocurrency market capitalization as the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site no we do not list all cryptocurrencies at coinmarketcap as a company and team we are very aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions while we cannot guarantee to exclude them all we have a vetting process that each coin goes through before it is listed on the site if we suspect that a coin or project is a scam it does not get listed at the time of writing we estimate that there are around coins tokens and projects in the global coin market as mentioned above we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed this process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site the very first cryptocurrency was bitcoin since it is open source it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency many people have done exactly this some of these coins are very similar to bitcoin with just one or two amended features such as litecoin while others are very different with varying models of security issuance and governance however they all share the same moniker every coin issued after bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin ico stands for initial coin offering many of the smaller projects in the crypto space and a few of the largest ones raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign investors would send funds usually in the form of bitcoin to the project and receive coin or tokens in return most icos happened in and early and used ethereum as a platform of operation via the erc standard in the united states securities and exchange commission sec clarified their rules relating to fundraising for assets which made it much harder for new cryptocurrency projects to issue their own tokens in this way since the appearance of the sec guidance and the organizations heightened interest in regulating icos for us citizens the number of icos has been reduced substantially price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market when asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed to overcome this problem a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies ranging from the us dollar other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies arose these new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability playtoearn pe games also known as gamefi has emerged as an extremely popular category in the crypto space it combines nonfungible tokens nft ingame crypto tokens decentralized

detailed explanation can be found in here contract specifications what is the difference between portfolio margin and standard margin default standard margin favours following trade strategies options buying your long options could not be liquidated in standard margin directional positions especially big leverage and no hedging you will be able to get more leverage in such strategy advanced portfolio margin model takes into consideration positions in futures and options combined thus potentially reducing the margin requirements of a portfolio it is best used with the following strategies hedged positions trading constructions with multiple legs or just hedged positions can benefit from shared margin greatly allowing to lower margin requirements and either lower risk or use higher leverage by that so the difference between pm and sm is that portfolio mode looks at how the entire portfolio of positions would perform together with changing market conditions please note that in pm mode margin requirements of your positions would be affected by more parameters than simple price movement whichever of these scenarios would inflict the largest loss to your portfolio this loss

me powered by duckduckgo blog essays whole site the softwaredefined car developers are starting to talk about the softwaredefined car for decades features have accumulated like cruft in new vehicles a box here to control the antilock brakes a module there to run the cruise control radar and so on now engineers and designers are rationalizing the way they go about building new models taking advantage of much more powerful hardware to consolidate all those discrete functions into a small number of domain controllers the behavior of new cars is increasingly defined by software too this is merely the progression of a trend that began at the end of the s with the introduction of the first electronic engine control units today code controls a cars engine and transmission or its electric motors and battery pack the steering brakes suspension interior and exterior lighting and more depending on how new and how expensive it is and those systems are being leveraged for convenience or safety features like adaptive cruise control lane keeping remote parking and so on and security another advantage of the move away from legacy designs is that digital security can be baked in from the start rather than patched onto components like a cars central area network that were never designed with the internet in mind if you design it from scratch its security by design everything is in by design you have it there but keep in mind that of course the more software there is in the car the more risk is there for vulnerabilities no question about this anhalt said at the same time theyre a great software system theyre highly secure theyre much more secure than a hardware system with a little bit of software it depends how the whole thing has been designed and there are so many regulations and eu standards that have been released in the last year year and a half that force oems to comply with these standards and get security inside she said i suppose it could end up that way it could also be a much bigger attack surface with a lot more hacking possibilities tags cars cybersecurity hacking posted on june at am comments friday squid blogging squid chromolithographs beautiful illustrations as usual you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that i havent covered read my blog posting guidelines here edited to add slashdot thread tags squid posted on june at pm comments opensource llms in february meta released its large language model llama unlike openai and its chatgpt meta didnt just give the world a chat window to play with instead it released the code into the opensource community and shortly thereafter the model itself was leaked researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it improving it and getting it to do things no one else anticipated and their results have been immediate innovative and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out training speeds have hugely increased and the size of the models themselves has shrunk to the point that you can create and run them on a laptop the world of ai research has dramatically changed this development hasnt made the same splash as other corporate announcements but its effects will be much greater it will wrest power from the large tech corporations resulting in both much more innovation and a much more challenging regulatory landscape the large corporations that had controlled these models warn that this freeforall will lead to potentially dangerous developments and problematic uses of the open technology have already been documented but those who are working on the open models counter that a more democratic research environment is better than having this powerful technology controlled by a small number of corporations the power shift comes from simplification the llms built by openai and google rely on massive data sets measured in the tens of billions of bytes computed on by tens of thousands of powerful specialized processors producing models with billions of parameters the received wisdom is that bigger data bigger processing and larger parameter sets were all needed to make a better model producing such a model requires the resources of a corporation with the money and computing power of a google or microsoft or meta but building on public models like metas llama the opensource community has innovated in ways that allow results nearly as good as the huge modelsbut run on home machines with common data sets what was once the reserve of the resourcerich has become a playground for anyone with curiosity coding skills and a good laptop bigger may be better but the opensource community is showing that smaller is often good enough this opens the door to more efficient accessible and resourcefriendly llms more importantly these smaller and faster llms are much more accessible and easier to experiment with rather than needing tens of thousands of machines and millions of dollars to train a new model an existing model can now be customized on a midpriced laptop in a few hours this fosters rapid innovation it also takes control away from large companies like google and openai by providing access to the underlying code and encouraging collaboration opensource initiatives empower a diverse range of developers researchers and organizations to shape the technology this diversification of control helps prevent undue influence and ensures that the development and deployment of ai technologies align with a broader set of values and priorities much of the modern internet was built on opensource technologies from the lamp linux apache mysql and phpperlpython stacka suite of applications often used in web development this enabled sophisticated websites to be easily constructed all with opensource tools that were built by enthusiasts not companies looking for profit facebook itself was originally built using opensource php but being opensource also means that there is no one to hold responsible for misuse of the technology when vulnerabilities are discovered in obscure bits of opensource technology critical to the functioning of the internet often there is no entity responsible for fixing the bug opensource communities span countries and cultures making it difficult to ensure that any countrys laws will be respected by the community and having the technology opensourced means that those who wish to use it for unintended illegal or nefarious purposes have the same access to the technology as anyone else this in turn has significant implications for those who are looking to regulate this new and powerful technology now that the opensource community is remixing llms its no longer possible to regulate the technology by dictating what research and development can be done there are simply too many researchers doing too many different things in too many different countries the only governance mechanism available to governments now is to regulate usage and only for those who pay attention to the law or to offer incentives to those including startups individuals and small companies who are now the drivers of innovation in the arena incentives for these communities could take the form of rewards for the production of particular uses of the technology or hackathons to develop particularly useful applications sticks are hard to useinstead we need appealing carrots it is important to remember that the opensource community is not always motivated by profit the members of this community are often driven by curiosity the desire to experiment or the simple joys of building while there are companies that profit from supporting software produced by opensource projects like linux python or the apache web server those communities are not profit driven and there are many opensource models to choose from alpaca cerebrasgpt dolly huggingchat and stablelm have all been released in the past few months most of them are built on top of llama but some have other pedigrees more are on their way the large tech monopolies that have been developing and fielding llmsgoogle microsoft and metaare not ready for this a few weeks ago a google employee leaked a memo in which an engineer tried to explain to his superiors what an opensource llm means for their own proprietary tech the memo concluded that the opensource community has lapped the major corporations and has an overwhelming lead on them this isnt the first time companies have ignored the power of the opensource community sun never understood linux netscape never understood the apache web server open source isnt very good at original innovations but once an innovation is seen and picked up the community can be a pretty overwhelming thing the large companies may respond by trying to retrench and pulling their models back from the opensource community but its too late we have entered an era of llm democratization by showing that smaller models can be highly effective enabling easy experimentation diversifying control and providing incentives that are not profit motivated opensource initiatives are moving us into a more dynamic and inclusive ai landscape this doesnt mean that some of these models wont be biased or wrong or used to generate disinformation or abuse but it does mean that controlling this technology is going to take an entirely different approach than regulating the large players this essay was written with jim waldo and previously appeared on slatecom edited to add slashdot thread tags artificial intelligence essays meta open source posted on june at am comments on the catastrophic risk of ai earlier this week i signed on to a short group statement coordinated by the center for ai safety mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war the press coverage has been extensive and surprising to me the new york times headline is ai poses risk of extinction industry leaders warn bbc artificial intelligence could lead to extinction experts warn other headlines are similar i actually dont think that ai poses a risk to human extinction i think it poses a similar risk to pandemics and nuclear warwhich is to say a risk worth taking seriously but not something to panic over which is what i thought the statement said in my talk at the rsa conference last month i talked about the power level of our species becoming too great for our systems of governance talking about those systems i said now add into this mix the risks that arise from new and dangerous technologies such as the internet or ai or synthetic biology or molecular nanotechnology or nuclear weapons here misaligned incentives and hacking can have catastrophic consequences for society that was what i was thinking about when i agreed to sign on to the statement pandemics nuclear weapons aiyeah i would put those three in the same bucket surely we can spend the same effort on ai risk as we do on future pandemics thats a really low bar clearly i should have focused on the word extinction and not the relative comparisons seth lazar jeremy howard and arvind narayanan wrote we think that in fact most signatories to the statement believe that runaway ai is a way off yet and that it will take a significant scientific advance to get therene that we cannot anticipate even if we are confident that it will someday occur if this is so then at least two things follow i agree with that and with their follow up first we should give more weight to serious risks from ai that are more urgent even if existing ai systems and their plausible extensions wont wipe us out they are already causing much more concentrated harm they are sure to exacerbate inequality and in the hands of powerhungry governments and unscrupulous corporations will undermine individual and collective freedom this is what i wrote in click here to kill everybody i am less worried about ai i regard fear of ai more as a mirror of our own society than as a harbinger of the future ai and intelligent robotics are the culmination of several precursor technologies like machine learning algorithms automation and autonomy the security risks from those precursor technologies are already with us and theyre increasing as the technologies become more powerful and more prevalent so while i am worried about intelligent and even driverless cars most of the risks arealready prevalent in internetconnected drivered cars and while i am worried about robot soldiers most of the risks are already prevalent in autonomous weapons systems also as roboticist rodney brooks pointed out long before we see such machines arising there will be the somewhat less intelligent and belligerent machines before that there will be the really grumpy machines before that the quite annoying machines and before them the arrogant unpleasant machines i think well see any new security risks coming long before they get here i do think we should worry about catastrophic ai and robotics risk its the fact that they affect the world in a direct physical mannerand that theyre vulnerable to class breaks other things to read david chapman is good on scary ai and kieran healy is good on the statement okay enough i should also learn not to sign on to group statements tags artificial intelligence risk assessment risks posted on june at am comments chinese hacking of us critical infrastructure everyone is writing about an interagency and international report on chinese hacking of us critical infrastructure lots of interesting details about how the group called volt typhoon accesses target networks and evades detection tags china cyberattack cyberespionage espionage hacking infrastructure reports posted on may at am comments bruteforcing a fingerprint reader its neither hard nor expensive unlike password authentication which requires a direct match between what is inputted and whats stored in a database fingerprint authentication determines a match using a reference threshold as a result a successful fingerprint bruteforce attack requires only that an inputted image provides an acceptable approximation of an image in the fingerprint database bruteprint manipulates the false acceptance rate far to increase the threshold so fewer approximate images are accepted bruteprint acts as an adversary in the middle between the fingerprint sensor and the trusted execution environment and exploits vulnerabilities that allow for unlimited guesses in a bruteprint attack the adversary removes the back cover of the device and attaches the circuit board that has the fingerprint database loaded in the flash storage the adversary then must convert the database into a fingerprint dictionary thats formatted to work with the specific sensor used by the targeted phone the process uses a neuralstyle transfer when converting the database into the usable dictionary this process increases the chances of a match with the fingerprint dictionary in place the adversary device is now in a position to input each entry into the targeted phone normally a protection known as attempt limiting effectively locks a phone after a set number of failed login attempts are reached bruteprint can fully bypass this limit in the eight tested android models meaning the adversary device can try an infinite number of guesses on the two iphones the attack can expand the number of guesses to three times higher than the five permitted the bypasses result from exploiting what the researchers said are two zeroday vulnerabilities in the smartphone fingerprint authentication framework of virtually all smartphones the vulnerabilitiesone known as camf cancelaftermatch fail and the other mal matchafterlockresult from logic bugs in the authentication framework camf exploits invalidate the checksum of transmitted fingerprint data and mal exploits infer matching results through sidechannel attacks depending on the model the attack takes between minutes and hours also the ability of bruteprint to successfully hijack fingerprints stored on android devices but not iphones is the result of one simple design difference ios encrypts the data and android does not other news articles research paper

doctrine about cyberattacks that also involve an actual human gaining physical access to a piece of computing infrastructure a revised version of joint publication cyberspace operationspublished in december and while unclassified is only available to those with dod common access cards according to a joint staff spokespersonofficially provides a definition for expeditionary cyberspace operations which are cyberspace operations that require the deployment of cyberspace forces within the physical domains developing access to targets in or through cyberspace follows a process that can often take significant time in some cases remote access is not possible or preferable and close proximity may be required using expeditionary cyber operations the joint publication states such operations are key to addressing the challenge of closed networks and other systems that are virtually isolated expeditionary co are often more regionally and tactically focused and can include units of the cmf or special operations forces if direct access to the target is unavailable or undesired sometimes a similar or partial effect can be created by indirect access using a related target that has higherorder effects on the desired target allowing them to support combatant commands in this way permits faster adaptation to rapidly changing needs and allows threats that initially manifest only in one area of responsibility to be mitigated globally in near real time likewise while synchronizing co missions related to achieving combatant commander objectives some cyberspace capabilities that support this activity may need to be forwarddeployed used in multiple aors simultaneously or for speed in timecritical situations made available via reachback it states this might involve augmentation or deployment of cyberspace capabilities to forces already forward or require expeditionary co by deployment of a fully equipped team of personnel and capabilities tags cyberattack cyberwar national

the strong incentives the blackhat seo crowd has to manipulate results its entirely possible that bad actors have been poisoning chatgpt for months we dont know because openai doesnt talk about their processes how they validate the prompts they use for training how they vet their training data set or how they finetune chatgpt their secrecy means we dont know if chatgpt has been safely managed theyll also have to update their training data set at some point they cant leave their models stuck in forever once they do update it we only have their word pinkyswear promises that theyve done a
